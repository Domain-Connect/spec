== Introduction and background

GoDaddy implemented a feature called Domain Connect that simplified how Service
Providers configured domains hosted at  GoDaddy (the DNS Provider). This made the end to end
experience considerably easier for the end user. 

Based on learnings from this implementation, an improved and more general version of this
protocol was created. This document describes Domain Connect 2.0 and is shared with the
intent of it becoming an open standard that can be utilized by multiple DNS Providers and
Service Providers to simplify this interaction across the internet. 

[glossary]
=== Terminology

[horizontal]
Service Providers:: refers to entities that provide products and
services attached to domain names. Examples include web hosting
providers (such as Wix or SquareSpace), email Service Providers (such as
Microsoft or Google) and potentially even hardware manufacturers with
DNS-enabled devices like home routers or automation controls (such as
Linksys, Nest, and Philips).

DNS Providers:: refers to entities that provide DNS services such as
registrars (such as GoDaddy or 1and1) or standalone DNS services (like
CloudFlare).

Customer/User:: refers to the end-user of these services.

Templates/Service Templates:: refers to a file that describes a set of
changes to DNS and domain functionality to enable a specific service.

Root Domain:: refers to a registered domain (e.g. example.com or
example.co.uk) or a delegated zone in DNS.

Sub Domain:: refers to a sub-domain of a root domain (e.g.
sub.example.com or sub.example.co.uk).

=== Problem Statement

Configuring a service at a Service Provider to work with a domain has
historically been a complex task that is difficult for users.

Typically a customer would try to configure their service by entering
their domain name with the Service Provider. The Service Provider then
used a number of techniques with mixed reliability to discover the DNS
Provider. This might include DNS queries for nameservers, queries to
whois, and mapping tables to figure out the registrar or company running
DNS.

Once the Service Provider discovered the DNS Provider, they typically
gave the customer instructions for proper configuration of DNS. This
might include help text, screen shots, or even links to the appropriate
tools.

Discovery of the DNS Provider in this manner is unreliable, and
providing instructions to users would present a number of technologies
(DNS record types, TTLs, Hostnames, etc.) and processes the end user didn’t
understand. And the instructions authored by the Service Provider often
quickly become out of date, further confusing the issue for users.

=== Goals

The goal of this specification is to create a system where Service
Providers can easily enable their applications/services to work with the
domain names of their customers. This includes both discovery of the DNS
Provider and subsequent modification of DNS.

The system will be implemented using simple web based interactions and
standard authentication protocols. The creation and modification of DNS
settings will be done through the application of templates instead of
direct manipulation of individual DNS records.

=== Templates

Templates are core to Domain Connect, as they describe a service owned by
a Service Provider and contain all of the information necessary to
enable and operate/maintain a service in the form of records.

The individual records may be identified by a groupId. This allows for
the application of templates in different stages. For example, an email
provider might first set a TXT record to verify the domain, and later
set an MX record to configure email delivery. While done separately,
both changes are fundamentally part of the same service.

Templates can also contain variable portions, as often values of data in
DNS changes based on the implementation and/or user of the
service (e.g. the IP address of a service, a customer id,
etc.).

Configuration and onboarding of templates between the DNS Provider and
the Service Provider is seen as a manual process. This is both from a 
business and technical point of view. Nnothing obligates a DNS Provider to onboard 
a Service Provider; with the template 
defined by the Service Provider and manually given to the DNS Provider. Future
versions of this specification may allow for an independent repository
of templates. For now the templates are all published at
http://domainconnect.org

By basing the protocol on templates instead of DNS Records, several
advantages are achieved. The DNS Provider has very explicit knowledge
and control of the settings being changed to enable a service. And the
system is more secure as templates are tightly controlled and contained.

=== Summary

* Domain Connect can make changes to DNS based on a service template and
avoid exposing DNS to customers and Service Providers.
* Domain Connect can have arbitrary parameters for known variables with
values that change per user.
* Domain Connect is easy for customers with a simple confirmation dialog
flow.
* For more complex integrations, Domain Connect has an oAuth based
implementation to provide an acceptable level of security, but allowing
for the Service Provider to call an API to apply a template at a later
time.

== Protocol Overview and End User Flows

To attach a domain name to a service provided by a Service Provider, the
customer would first enter their domain name.

Instead of relying on examination of the nameservers and mapping these
to DNS Providers, DNS Provider discovery would be handled through simple
records in DNS and an API. The Service Provider can query for a specific
record in the zone to determine a REST endpoint to initiate the
protocol. A Domain Connect compliant DNS Provider would return
information about that domain and how to configure it using Domain
Connect.

To apply the changes to DNS, there are two use cases. The
first is a synchronous web flow, and the second is an asynchronous flow
using oAuth and an API.

It should be noted that a DNS Provider may choose to only implement one
of the flows. As a matter of practice many Service Providers are based
on the synchronous flow, with only a handful of them based on the
asynchronous oAuth flow. So many DNS providers may opt to only implement
the synchronous flow.

It should also be noted that individual services may work with the
synchronous flow only, the asynchronous flow only, or with both.

=== The Synchronous Flow

This flow is tailored for the Service Provider that requires a one time
synchronous change to DNS.

The user would first enter their domain name at the Service Provider
website.

image::.//media/image1.png[image,width=500,height=325]

After the Service Provider determines the DNS Provider, the Service
Provider might display a link to the user indicating that they can
"Connect their Domain" to the service.

image::.//media/image2.png[image,width=502,height=325]

After clicking the link, the user is directed to a browser window on the
DNS Provider’s site. This is typically done in another tab or in a new
browser window, but can also be an in place navigation with a return
url. This link would pass the domain name being modified, the service
provider and template being enabled, and any additional parameters
needed to configure the service.

Once at the DNS Provider site, the user would be asked to authenticate
if necessary.

image::.//media/image3.png[image,width=495,height=318]

After authenticating at the DNS Provider, the DNS Provider would verify
the domain name is owned by the user. The DNS Provider would also verify
other parameters passed in are valid and would prompt the user to give
consent for making the change to DNS. The DNS Provider could also warn
the user of services that would be disabled by applying this change to
DNS.

image::.//media/image4.png[image,width=489,height=312]

Assuming the user grants this consent, the DNS changes would be applied.

Upon successful application of the DNS changes, if invoked in a pop-up
window or tab the browser window would be closed. If in place the user
would be redirected back to the Service Provider.

=== The Asynchronous Flow

The asynchronous oAuth flow is tailored for the Service Provider that
wishes to make changes to DNS asynchronously with respect to the user
interaction, or wishes to make multiple or additional changes to DNS
over time.

The oAuth based authentication and authorization flow begins similarly
to the web based synchronous flow. The Service Provider determines the
DNS Provider and links to a consent dialog at the DNS Provider. Once at
the DNS Provider the user signs in, the ownership of the domain is
verified, and consent is granted.

Instead of applying the DNS changes on user consent, oAuth access is
granted to the Service Provider. An oAuth access code is generated and
handed back to the Service Provider. The Service Provider then requests
an access (bearer) token.

The permission granted in the oAuth token is a right for the Service
Provider to apply a requested template (or templates) to the specific
domain (and specific subdomains) owned by a specific user.

The Service Provider would later call the oAuth API to apply a template
using the access token. This is a simple API that allows the application
or removal of a template given authorization.

Additional parameters are expected to be passed as name/value pairs on
the query string of each API call.

== DNS Provider Discovery

To facilitate discovery of the DNS Provider from a domain name, a domain
will contain a record in DNS.

This record will be a simple TXT record containing a URL used as a
prefix for calling a discovery API. This record will be named __domainconnect_.

An example of the contents of this record might contain:

[source]
----
domainconnect.virtucondomains.com
----

As a practical matter of implementation, the DNS Provider need not
contain a copy of this data in each and every zone. Instead, the DNS
Provider needs simply to respond to the DNS query for the
__domainconnect_ TXT record with the appropriate data.

How this is implemented is up to the DNS Provider.

For example, the DNS Provider may not store the data inside a TXT record
for the domain, opting instead to put a CNAME in the zone and have the
TXT record in the target of the CNAME. Another DNS Provider might simply
respond with the appropriate records without having the data in each
zone.

Once the URL prefix is discovered, it is used by the Service Provider to
determine the additional settings for using Domain Connect on this
domain at the DNS Provider. This is done by calling a REST API.

[source]
----
GET

https://{_domainconnect}/v2/{domain}/settings
----

This will return a JSON structure containing the settings to use for
Domain Connect on the domain name (passed in on the path) at the DNS
Provider. This JSON structure will contain the following fields.

[cols=",,,",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|*Field*
|*Key*
|*Type*
|*Description*
|*Provider Id*
|providerId
|String
|Unique identifier for the DNS Provider. Typically, the domain name (e.g. virtucom.com).

|*Provider Name* 
|providerName
|String 
|The name of the DNS Provider.

|*Provider Display Name* 
|providerDisplayName 
|String 
|The name of the DNS Provider that should be displayed by the Service Provider. This
might change for some DNS Providers that white label their infrastructure.

|*UX URL Prefix for Synchronous Flows* 
|urlSyncUX 
|String 
|The URL Prefix for linking to the UX of Domain Connect for the synchronous flow at the DNS
Provider. If not returned, the DNS Provider is not supporting the synchronous flow on this
domain.

|*UX URL Prefix for Asynchronous Flows*
|urlAsyncUX 
|String 
|The URL Prefix for linking to the UX elements of Domain Connect for the asynchronous flow
at the DNS Provider. If not returned, the DNS Provider is not supporting the asynchronous
flow on this domain.

|*API URL Prefix* 
|urlAPI 
|String 
|This is the URL Prefix for the REST API

|*Width of Window*
|width 
|Number 
|This is the desired width of the window for granting consent when navigated in a popup.
Default value is 750px.

|*Height of Window* 
|height 
|Number 
|This is the desired height of the window for granting consent when navigated in a popup.
Default value is 750px.

|*UX URL Control Panel* 
|urlControlPanel 
|String 
|This is a URL to the control panel for editing DNS at the DNS Provider. This field is
optional, and allows a Service Provider whose template isn't supported at the DNS Provider
to provide a direct link to perform manual edits.

To allow deep links to the specific domain, this string may contain %domain% which should be
replaced with the domain.
|=======================================================================

As an example, the JSON returned by this call might contain.

[source,json]
----
{
	"providerId": "vicrucomdomains.com",
	"providerName": "Virtucon Domains",
	"providerDisplayName": "Virtucon Domains",
	"urlSyncUX": "https://domainconnect.virtucondomains.com",
	"urlAsyncUX": "https://domainconnect.virtucondomains.com",
	"urlAPI": "https://api.domainconnect.virtucondomains.com",
	"width": 750,
	"height": 750,
	"urlControlPanel": "https://domaincontrolpanel.virtucondomains.com"
}
----

Discovery should work on the root domain (zone) only. Bear in mind that 
zones can be delegated to other users, making this information valuable to
Service Providers since the DNS changes may be different for an apex zone vs. 
a sub-domain for an individual service.

It should be noted that it is possible a zone returns a value for the
_domainconnect TXT record query, but that a subsequent call for the JSON
fails. For example, a zone may errantly have a value for this record. Or
a DNS Provider may decide to place the record in all zones, even for
some where Domain Connect isn’t enabled.

== Domain Connect Details

=== Endpoints

The Domain Connect contains endpoints returned in the JSON during
discovery are in the form of URLs.

The first set of endpoints are for the UX that the Service Provider
links to. These are for the synchronous flow where the user can click
link to grant consent for and to configure the domain, and for the
asynchronous oAuth flow where the user can click to grant consent for
oAuth access.

The second set of endpoints are for the API endpoints via REST.

All endpoints begin with a root URL for the DNS Provider such as:

[source]
----
https://connect.dnsprovider.com
----

They may also include any prefix at the discretion of the DNS Provider.
For example:

[source]
----
https://connect.dnsprovider.com/api
----

The root URLs for the UX endpoints and the API endpoints are returned in
the JSON payload during DNS Provider discovery.

=== Synchronous Flow

==== Query Supported Template

[source]
----
GET

{urlAPI}/v2/domainTemplates/providers/{providerId}/services/{serviceId}
----

This URL can be used by the Service Provider to determine if the DNS
Provider supports a specific template through the synchronous flow.

Returning a status of 200 without a body indicates the template is
supported. Returning a status of 404 indicates the template is not
supported.

==== Apply Template

[source]
----
GET

{urlSyncUX}/v2/domainTemplates/providers/{providerId}/services/{serviceId}/apply?[properties]
----

This is the URL used to ask for consent and to apply a template to a
domain. It is called from the Service Provider to start the Domain
Connect Protocol.

This URL can be called in one of two ways. 

===== New Browser Window

The first is through a new browser
tab or in a popup browser window. The DNS Provider would sign the user
in if necessary, verify domain ownership, and ask for confirmation
before application of the template. After application of the template,
the DNS Provider would automatically close the browser tab or window.

===== Same Browser Window
The second is in the current browser tab/window. As above the DNS
Provider would sign the user in if necessary, verify domain ownership,
and ask for confirmation before application of the template. After
application of the template (or cancellation by the user), the DNS
Provider would redirect the browser to a return URL (redirect_uri).

Several parameters may be appended to the end of this redirect_uri.

* State
+
If a state parameter is passed in on the query string, this will be
passed back as state= on the redirect_uri.

* Error
+
If authorization could not be obtained or an error has occurred, the
parameter error= will be appended. For consistency with the asynchronous
oAuth flows the valid values for the error parameter will be as
specified in oAuth 2.0 RFC 6749 (4.1.2.1. Error Response - "error"
parameter). Valid values are: invalid_request, unauthorized_client,
access_denied, unsupported_response_type, invalid_scope, server_error,
and temporarilly_unavailable.

* Error Description
+
When an error occurs, an optional error description containing a
developer focused error description may be returned.
+
Under normal
operation the access_denied error can be returned for a number of
reasons. For example, the user may not have access to the account that
owns the domain. Even if they do and successfully sign-in, the account
or the domain may be suspended.
+
It is unlikely that the DNS Provider would want to leak this information
to the Service Provider, and as such the description may be vague.
+
There is however one piece of information that may be interesting to communicate
to the Service Provider. This is when the end user decides to cancel the
operation. Should the DNS Provider wish to communicate this to the
Service Provider, when the error=access_denied the error_description can
contain the prefix "user_cancel". Again, this is left to the discretion
of the DNS Provider.

To prevent an open redirect, unless the request is digitally signed the redirect_uri
must be within the domain specified in the template in syncRedirectDomain.

===== Conflict Detection

It is recommended that the DNS Provider detect and display conflicts to the user. This is 
optional, and the only requirement is that after the template is applied the DNS changes are
succesfully applied.

===== Parameters/properties passed to this URL include:

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Property 
|Key 
|Description

|*Domain*
|domain 
|This parameter contains the domain name being configured. This is the root domain, typically the
registered domain or delegated zone.

|*Host*
|host
|This is an optional host name of the sub domain. If left blank, the template is being applied to
the root domain. Otherwise the template is applied to the sub domain within the domain.

|*Redirect URI*
|redirect_uri
|The location to direct the client browser to upon successful authorization, or upon error. 
The parameter is optional, and if omitted the DNS Provider will close the browser window upon
completion. It must either be scoped to the syncRedirectDomain
from the template, or the request must be signed.

|*State*
|state
|(optional) This is a random, unique string passed along to prevent CSRF, or to pass back state. It
will be returned as a parameter when
redirecting to the redirect_uri described above.

|*Name/Value Pairs*
|Any key that will be used as a replacement for the “% surrounded” value(s) in a template.
|Any variable fields consumed by this template. The name portion of this API call corresponds to
the variable(s) specified in the template and the value corresponds to the value that should 
be used when applying the template.

|*Provider Name*
|providerName
|(optional) This parameter specifies the provider name for display in the UX. It allows for
application of a template for a service that is sold through different companies. Not all templates
allow for this capability. See Shared Templates below.

|*Group Id*
|groupId
|(optional) This parameter specifies the group of changes from the template to apply. If no group is specified, all groups are applied. Multiple groups can be specified in comma delimited format.

|*Signature*
|sig
|(optional) A signature of the query string. See Security Considerations section below.

|*Key*
|key
|(optional) A value containing the host in DNS where the public key for the signature can be obtained. The domain for this host is in the template in syncPubKeyDomain.
|=======================================================================

An example query string is below:

[source]
----
GET

https://web-connect.dnsprovider.com/v2/domainTemplates/providers/coolprovider.com/services/hosting/apply?www=192.168.42.42&m=192.168.42.43&domain=example.com
----

This call indicates that the Service Provider wishes to connect the
domain example.com to the service using the template identified by the
composite key of the provider (coolprovider.com) and the service owned
by them (hosting). In this example, there are two variables in this
template, "www" and "m" which both require values (in this case each
requires an IP address). These variables are passed as name/value pairs.

==== Security Considerations

By applying a template with parameters, there is a security
consideration that must be taken into account.

Consider an email template where the IP address of the MX record is
passed in through a variable. A bad actor could generate a URL with a
malicious IP and phish the user. If an end user is convinced to click on
this link, they would land on the DNS Provider site to confirm the
change. To the user, this would appear to be a valid request to
configure the domain. Yet the IP would be hijacking the service.

Not all templates have this problem. But when they do, there are several
options.

===== Disable Synchronous

One option would be to not enable the synchronous flow and use
asynchronous oAuth. This can be controlled with the syncBlock
value from the template. However, as will be seen below oAuth has both a higher
implementation burden and requires onboarding between each Service and
DNS Provider.

===== Digitally Sign Requests

Another option would be to digitally sign the query string. A
signature is appended as an additional query string parameter,
properly URL encoded and of the form:

[source]
----
sig=NLOQQm6ikGC2FlFvFZqIFNCZqlaC4B%2FQDwS6iCwIElMWhXMgRnRE17zhLtdLFieWkyqKa4I%2FOoFaAgd%2FAl%2ByzDd3sM2X1JVF5ELjTlj84jZ4KOEIdnbgkEeO%2FTkYRrPkwcmcHMwc4RuX%2Fqio8vKYxJaKLKeVGpUNSKo7zkq3XIRgyxoLSRKxmlSTHFAz4LvYXPWo6SHDoVcRvElWj18Um13sSXuX4KhtOLym2yImHpboEi4m2Ziigc%2BNHZE0VvHUR7wZgDaB01z8hFm5ATF%2B8swjandMRf2Lr4Syv4qTxMNT61r62EWFkt5t9nhxMgss6z4pfDVFZ3vYwSJDGuRpEQ%3D%3D
----

The Service Provider can generate this signature using a private key.

The DNS Provider can then verify the signature using the public key.

Note: The signature is generated from the query string, excluding the key 
and sig fields.

The public key will be placed in a TXT DNS Record in a domain specified
in the template. To allow for key rotation, the host name of the TXT
record will be appended as another variable on the query string of the
form:

[source]
----
key=_dcpubkeyv1
----

This example indicates that the public key can be found by doing a DNS
query for a TXT record called _dcpubkeyv1 in the domain specified in the
syncPubKeyDomain from the template.

Since the public key may be greater than 255 characters, multiple TXT
records may exist for the DNS TXT query. For a public key of:

[source]
----
MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8AMIIBCgKCAQEA1dCqv7JEzUOfbhWKB9mTRsv3O9Vzy1Tz3UQlIDGpnVrTPBJDQTXUhxUMREEOBKo+rOjHZqfYnSmlkgu1dnBEO8bsELQL8GjS4zsjdA53gRk2SDxuzcB4fK+NCDfnRHut5nG0S3U4cq4DuGrMDFVBwxH1duTsqDNgIOOfNTsFcWSVXoSSTqCCMGbj8Vt51umDhWQAj06lf50qP2/jMNs2G+KTlk3dBHx3wtqYLvdcop1Tk5xBD64BPJ9uwm8KlDNHe+8O+cC9j04Ji8B2K0/PzAj90xnb8XJy/EM124hpT9lMgpHKBUvdeurJYweC6oP41gsTf5LrpjnyIy9j5FHPCQIDAQAB
----

There would be several TXT records. The records would be of the form:

[source]
----
p=1,a=RS256,t=x509,d=MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8AMIIBCgKCAQEA1dCqv7JEzUOfbhWKB9mTRsv3O9Vzy1Tz3UQlIDGpnVrTPBJDQTXUhxUMREEOBKo+rOjHZqfYnSmlkgu1dn

p=2,a=RS256,t=x509,d=BEO8bsELQL8GjS4zsjdA53gRk2SDxuzcB4fK+NCDfnRHut5nG0S3U4cq4DuGrMDFVBwxH1duTsqDNgIOOfNTsFcWSVXoSSTqCCMGbj8Vt51umDhWQAj06lf5

p=3,a=RS256,t=x509,d=NCDfnRHut5nG0S3U4cq4DuGrMDFVBwxH1duTsqDNgIOOfNTsFcWSVXoSSTqCCMGbj8Vt51umDhWQAj06lf50qP2/jMNs2G+KTlk3dBHx3wtqYLvdcop1Tk5xBD64BPJ9

p=4,a=RS256,t=x509,d=uwm8KlDNHe+8O+cC9j04Ji8B2K0/PzAj90xnb8XJy/EM124hpT9lMgpHKBUvdeurJYweC6oP41gsTf5LrpjnyIy9j5FHPCQIDAQAB
----

Here the public key is broken into four records in DNS, and the data
also indicates that the signing algorithm is an RSA Signature with
SHA-256 using an x509 certificate. The value for "a" if omitted will be
assumed to be RS256, and for "t" will be assumed to be x509.

Note: The only algorithm currently supported is SHA-256 with x509 certificates. The value is placed here for future compatability.

The above data was generated for a query string:

[source]
----
a=1&b=2&ip=10.10.10.10&domain=foobar.com
----

Support for signing the query string and verification is optional. Not
all services require or are able to provide this level of security. Presence of the
*syncPubKeyDomain* in the template indicates that the template requires
signature verification.

Note: The digital signature will be generated on the full query string only, 
excluding the sig and key parameters. This is everything after the ?, except the sig and key values.

The values of each query string
value will be properly URL Encoded before the signature is generated.

===== Warnings

Some applications aren't able to use oAuth and/or sign requests. 

When this is the case it is highly recommended (as always) that the template be constrained.
However, when this is not possible and the template is susceptible to phishing style attacks the
flag *warnPhishing* should be set to true in the template. 

When set this indicates to the DNS Provider that they should display extra warnings to the user to
ensure the link was/is from a reputable source before applying the template.

==== Shared Templates

Most services are enabled and sold by the same company. However, some
Service Providers have a reseller channel. This allows the service to be
provided by the Service Provider, but sold through third party
resellers. It is often this third party reseller that configures DNS.

While each reseller could enable Domain Connect, this is inefficient for
the DNS Providers. Enabling a single template that is shared by multiple
resellers would be more optimal.

To facilitate this, the ability to pass in the name of the reseller in
the synchronous flow is provided for some templates. This allows the DNS
Provider to display the name of the reseller in the confirmation user
experience.

As an example, the message can now read “(Reseller) XYZ would like to
make your domain example.com work with ACME Websites.”

In this example, ACME Websites is a service provided by ACME but resold
through XYZ.

This should only work for templates that have set the "shared" attribute
to true.

==== Verification of Changes

There are circumstances where the Service Provider may wish to verify
that the template was successfully applied. Without domain connect, this
typically involved the Service Provider querying DNS to see if the
changes to DNS had been made.

This same technique works with Domain Connect, and if necessary can be
triggered either manually on the Service Provider site or automatically
upon page/window activation in the browser when the browser window for
the DNS Provider is closed.

When the redirect_uri is used and an error is not present in the URI,
the Service Provider can not assume the changes were applied to DNS. While true in most
circumstances, users can tamper or alter the return
url in the browser. As such it is recommend that enablement of a service be based on verification
of changes to DNS.

=== Asynchronous Flow: oAuth

Using the oAuth flow is a more advanced use case needed by Service
Providers that have more complex configurations that may require
multiple steps and/or are asynchronous from the user’s interaction.

Details of an oAuth implementation are beyond the scope of this
specification. Instead, an overview of how oAuth is used by Domain
Connect is given here.

==== oAuth Flow: Setup

Service providers wishing to use the oAuth flow must register as an
oAuth client with the DNS provider. This is envisioned as a manual
process.

To register, the Service Provider would provide (in addition to their
template) any configuration necessary for the DNS Providers oAuth
implementation. This includes valid URLs and Domains for redirects upon
success or errors.

Note: The validity of redirects are very important in any oAuth implementation. 
Most oAuth vunerabilities are a combination of a leaked redirect and/or a compromised secret.

In return, the DNS provider will give the Service Provider a client id
and secret which will be used when requesting tokens. It is also
recommended that the client id is the same as the providerId.

==== oAuth Flow: Getting an Authorization Code

[source]
----
GET

{urlAsyncUX}/v2/domainTemplates/providers/{providerId}
----

To initiate the oAuth flow the Service Provider would link to the DNS
Provider to gain consent.

This endpoint is similar to the synchronous flow described above, and
will handle authenticating the user, verification of domain ownership,
and asking for the user’s permission to allow the Service Provider to
make the specified changes to the domain on their behalf. Similarly the
DNS Provider will often want to warn the user that (eventual)
application of a template might change existing records and/or disrupt
existing services attached to the domain.

While the variables for the applied template would be provided later,
the values of some variables are necessary to determine conflicts. As
such, any variables impacting conflicting records needs to be provided
in the consent flow. Today this includes variables in hosts, and
variables in the data portion for certain TXT records. As conflict
resolution evolves, this list may grow.

The protocol allows for the Service Provider to gain consent for the
application of multiple templates (specified in the scope parameter)
applied to multiple domains/sub-domains (specified in the domain and
host parameter). If conflict detection is implemented by the DNS
Provider, they should account for all permutations.

The scope parameter is a space separated list of the templates (as per
the oAuth protocol). The host parameter is an optional comma separated
list of hosts. A blank entry for the host implies the template can be
applied to the root domain. For example:

[cols=",",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|*Query String*
|*Description*
|scope=t1+t2&domain=example.com
|Templates "t1" and "t2" can be applied to example.com

|scope=t1+t2&domain=example.com&host=sub1,sub2
|Templates "t1" and "t2" can be applied to sub1.example.com or sub2.example.com

|scope=t1+t2&domain=example.com&host=sub1,
|Templates "t1" and "t2" can be applied to example.com or sub1.example.com
|=======================================================================

Upon successful authorization/verification/consent from the user, the
DNS Provider will direct the end user’s browser to the redirect URI. The
authorization code will be appended to this URI as a query parameter of
"code".

Similar to the synchronous flow, upon error the DNS provider will append
an error code as query parameter "error". These errors are also from the
oAuth 2.0 RFC 6749 (4.1.2.1. Error Response - "error" parameter). Valid
values include: invalid_request, unauthorized_client, access_denied,
unsupported_response_type, invalid_scope, server_error, and
temorarilly_unavailable. An optional error_description suitable for
developers can also be returned at the discretion of the DNS Provider.
The same considerations as in the synchronous flow apply here.

The state value passed into the consent will be passed back on the query
string as "state=".

The following table describes the values to be included in the query
string parameters for the request for the oAuth consent flow.

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Property
|Key
|Description

|*Domain*
|domain
|This parameter contains the domain name being
configured. This is the root domain, typically the registered domain or
delegated zone.

|*Host*
|host
|This is an optional list of comma separated host names upon which the template may be applied. An
empty string implies the root.

|*Client Id*
|client_id
|This is the client id that was provided by the DNS provider to the service provider 
during registration. It is recommended that this be the same as the providerId in the template.

|*Redirect URI*
|redirect_uri
|The location to direct the client’s browser upon successful authorization, or upon error.
Validation of the redirect_uri will be done by verifying the host (domain) name matches registered
hosts as part of onboarding.

|*Response type*
|response_type
|OPTIONAL. If included should be the string ‘code’ to indicate an authorization code is being
requested.

|*Scope*
|scope
|The oAuth scope corresponds to the requested templates. This is list of space separated
serviceIds.

|*State*
|state
|OPTIONAL but recommended. This is a random, unique string passed along to prevent CSRF. It will be
returned as a parameter when redirecting to the redirect_url described above.

|*Name/Value Pairs*
|Any key that will be used as a replacement for the “% surrounded” value(s) in a template required
for conflict detection.
|Required for fields that impact the conflict detection. This includes variables used in hosts and
data in TXT records.
|=======================================================================

==== oAuth Flow: Requesting an Access Token

[source]
----
POST

{urlAPI}/v2/oauth/access_token
----

Once authorization has been granted the Service Provider must use the
Authorization Code provided to request an Access Token. The oAuth
specification recommends that the Authorization Code be a short lived
token, and a reasonable recommended setting is ten minutes. As such this
exchange needs to be completed before that time has expired or the
process will need to be repeated.

This token exchange is typically done via a server to server API call from the
Service Provider to the DNS Provider using a POST. When called in this manner a secret is provided
along with the Authorization Code.

oAuth does allow for retreiving the access token without a secret. This is typically done when the
oAuth client is a client application.
When onboarding with the DNS Provider this would need to be enabled.

When the secret is provided (which is the normal case), care must be taken. A malicious
user could return false JSON
information in their domain, the urlAPI read from the JSON during discovery should not be used for
this call. Instead, the Service Provider
would maintain this urlAPI along with the secret per DNS Provider.

The following table describes the POST parameters to be included in the
request for the access token. The parameters should be accepted via the
query string or the body of the post. This is again particularly
important for the client_secret, as passing secrets via a query string
is generally frowned upon given that various systems often log URLs.

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Property
|Key
|Description

|*Authorization Code/Refresh Code*
|code/refresh_token
|The authorization code that was
provided in the previous step when the customer accepted the
authorization request, or the refresh_token for a subsequent access
token.

|*Redirect URI*
|redirect_uri
|This is required if a redirect_uri is
passed to request the authorization code. When included, it needs to be
the same redirect_uri provided in this step.

|*Grant type*
|grant_type
|The type of code in the request. Usually the
string ‘authorization_code’ or ‘refresh_token’

|*Client ID*
|client_id
|This is the client id that was provided by the
DNS provider, to the Service Provider during registration

|*Client Secret*
|client_secret
|The secret provided to the Service
Provider during registration. Typically required unless the rare circumstance with secret-less
oAuth.
|=======================================================================

Upon successful token exchange, the DNS Provider will return a response
with 4 properties in the body of the response.

[cols=",",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Property
|Description

|access_token
|The access token to be used when making API requests

|*token_type*
|Always the string "bearer"

|*expires_in*
|The number of seconds until the access_token expires

|*refresh_token*
|The token that can be used to request new access tokens
when this one has expired.
|=======================================================================

==== oAuth Flow: Making Requests with Access Tokens

Once the Service Provider has the access token, they can call the DNS
Provider’s API to make change to DNS on the domain by applying and
removing authorized templates. These templates can be applied to the
root domain or to any sub-domain of the root domain authorized.

All calls to this API pass the access token in the Authorization Header
of the request to the call to the API. More details can be found in the
oAuth specifications, but as an example:

[source]
----
GET /resource/1 HTTP/1.1

Host: example.com

Authorization: Bearer mF_9.B5f-4.1JqM
----

While the calls below do not have the same security consideration of
passing the secret, it is recommend that the urlAPI be from a stored
value vs. the runtime query for these as well.

==== oAuth Flow: Apply Template to Domain.

[source]
----
POST

{urlAPI}/v2/domainTemplates/providers/{providerId}/services/{serviceId}/apply?[properties]
----

The primary function of the API is to apply a template to a customer
domain.

While the providerId is implied in the authorization, this is on the
path for consistency with the synchronous flows and other APIs. If not
matching what was authorized, an error would be returned.

When applying a template to a domain, it is possible that a conflict may
exist with previous settings. While it is recommended that conflicts be
detected when the user grants consent, because oAuth is asynchronous it
is possible that a new conflict was introduced by the user.

While it is up to the DNS Provider to determine what constitutes a
conflict (see section on Conflicts below), when one is detected calling
this API should return an error. This error will enumerate the
conflicting records in a format described below.

Because the user isn’t present at the time of this error, it is up the
Service Provider to determine how to handle this error. Some providers
may decide to notify the user. Others may decide to apply their template
anyway using the "force" parameter. This parameter will bypass error
checks for conflicts, and after the call the service will be in its
desired state.

Calls to apply a template via oAuth require the following parameters
posted to the above URL. The DNS Provider should accept parameters in
the body or in the query string of this POST.

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Property
|Key
|Description

|Domain
|domain
|This contains the root domain name being configured. It
must match the domain that was authorized in the token.

|*Host*
|host
|This is the host name of the sub domain of the root domain.
If omitted or left blank, the template is being applied to the root
domain.

|*Name/Value Pairs*
|Any key that will be used as a replacement for the “%
surrounded” value(s) in a template.
|Any variable fields consumed by
this template. The name portion of this API call corresponds to the
variable(s) specified in the record and the value corresponds to the
value that should be used when applying the template as per the
implementation notes.

|*Group ID*
|groupId
|(optional) This parameter specifies the group of
changes in the template to apply. If omitted, all changes are applied.
This can also be a comma separated list of groupIds.

|*Force*
|force
|(optional) Thisparameter specifies that the template
should be applied independently of any conflicts that may exist on the
domain. This can be a value of 0 or 1.
|=======================================================================

An example call is below. In this example, it is contemplated that there
are two variables in this template, "www" and "m" which both require
values (in this case each requires an IP address). These variables are
passed as name/value pairs.

[source]
----
POST

https://connect.dnsprovider.com/v2/domainTemplates/providers/coolprovider.com/services/hosting/apply?www=192.168.42.42&m=192.168.42.43&force=1
----

The API must validate the access token, and that the domain belongs to
the customer and is represented by the token being presented. Any errors
with variables, conflicting templates, or problems with the state of the
domain are returned and returned; otherwise the template is applied.

Results of this call can include information indicating success or an
error. Errors will be 400 status codes, with the following codes
defined.

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Status
|Response
|Description

|Success
|20*
|A response of an http status code of 204 indicates that
call was successful and the template applied. Note that any 200 level
code should be considered a success.

|*Unauthorized*
|401
|A response of a 401 indicates that caller is not
authorized to make this call. This can be because the token was revoked,
or other access issues.

|*Error*
|400, 404, 422
|This indicates something wrong with the request
itself, such as bad parameters.

|*Failed*
|409
|This indicates that the call was good, and the caller
authorized, but the change could not be applied due to a conflicting
template. Errors due to conflicts will only be returned when force is
not equal to 1.
|=======================================================================

When a 409 is returned, the body of the response will contain details of
the error. This will be JSON containing the error code, a message
suitable for developers, and an array of tuples containing the
conflicting records type, host, and data element.

As an example:

[source,json]
----
{
	"code": "409",
	"message": "Conflicting records",
	"records": [
		{
			"type": "CNAME",
			"host": "www",
			"data": "@"
		},
		{
			"type": "A",
			"host": "@",
			"data": "random ip"
		}
	]
}
----

In this example, the Service Provider tried to apply a new hosting
template. The domain had an existing service applied for hosting.

==== oAuth Flow: Revert Template

This call reverts the application of a specific template from a domain.

[source]
----
POST

{urlAPI}/v2/domainTemplates/providers/{providerId}/services/{serviceId}/revert?domain={domain}&host={host}
----

This API allows the removal of a template from a customer domain/host
using an oAuth request.

The provider and service name in the authorization token must match the
values in the URL.

This call must validate that the template requested exists and has been
applied to the domain by the Service Provider, or a warning must be
returned that the call would have no effect.

An example query string might look like:

[source]
----
POST

https://connect.dnsprovider.com/v2/domainTemplates/providers/coolprovider.com/services/hosting/revert?domain=example.com
----

The only parameters are the domain and host. The DNS Provider should be
able to accept these on the query string or in the body of the POST.

Response codes Success, Authorization, and Errors are identical to
above.

==== oAuth Flow: Revoking access

Like all oAuth flows, the user can revoke the access at any time using
UX at the DNS Provider site. As such the Service Provider needs to be
aware that their access to the API may be denied.

== Domain Connect Objects and Templates

=== Template Versioning

Templates are not versioned. Instead, if a breaking change is made to a
template it is recommended that a new template be created. While on the
surface versioning looks appealing, the reality is that the settings in
a template rarely change. This is because a successful service will have
many customers with settings in their DNS, some applied by templates
using this protocol, and some manually applied. As such changes to the
template need to be done in a manner that accounts for existing
customers.

For some template changes such as the addition of a new record, the
template is largely backward compatible. With the caveats that the
template would need to be on-boarded with the DNS Providers and that
only new applications of the template would have the change.

=== Template Definition

A template is defined as a standard JSON data structure containing the
following data:

[cols=",,,",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Data Element
|Type
|Key
|Description

|*Service Provider Id*
|String
|providerId
|The unique identifier of the
Service Provider that created this template. This is used in the URLs to
identify the Service Provider. To ensure non-coordinated uniqueness, it
is recommended that this be the domain name of the Service Provider.

|*Service Provider Name*
|String
|providerName
|The name of the Service
Provider. This may be displayed to the user on the DNS Provider consent
UX.

|*Service Id*
|String
|serviceId
|The name or identifier of the template.
This is used in URLs to identify the template. It is also used in the
scope parameter for oAuth. It should not contain space characters.

|*Service Name*
|String
|serviceName
|The friendly name of this service.
This may be displayed to the user.

|*Logo*
|String
|logoUrl
|A graphical logo for use in any web-based flow.
This is a URL to a graphical logo sufficient for retrieval.

|*Description*
|Text
|description
|A textual description of what this
template attempts to do. This is meant to assist integrators, and
therefore should not be displayed to the user.

|*Synchronous Block*
|Boolean
|syncBlock
|Indicates that the synchronous
protocol should not be enabled for this template. The default for this
is false.

|*Shared*
|Boolean
|shared
|Indicates that the template is shared and the
provider name can be passed in on the query string. If not 
shared the name is not used from the query string. The default for this
is false.

|*Synchronous Public Key Domain*
|String
|syncPubKeyDomain
|When present,
indicates that calls to apply a template synchronously will be digitally
signed. This element contains the domain name for querying the TXT
record from DNS that contains the public key information.

|*Synchronous Redirect Domain*
|String
|syncRedirectDomain
|(optional)
When present, this is the domain name for which redirects must be sent
to with the response for the configuration. 

|*Warn Phishing*
|Boolean
|warnPhishing
|(optional)
When present, this tells the DNS Provider that the template may contain 
variables susceptiable to phishing attacks and the provider is unable to digitally sign the
requests. The default value for this is false.

|*Template Records*
|Array of Template Records
|records
|A list of records
for the template.
|=======================================================================

=== Template Record

Each template record is an entry that contains a type and several
other values depending on the type.

For all entries of a record other than "type" and "groupId", the value
can contain variables denoted by %<variable name>%. These are the values
substituted at runtime when writing into DNS. There are three built in variables:

* %host%: This is the host passed from the query string.
* %domain%: This is the domain passed from the query string.
* %fqdn%: This is the fully qualified domain name, with a trailing dot. This is sometimes conveniently specified as @.

It should be noted that as a best practice, the variable should be constrained
to as small as possible a portion of the resulting DNS record.

For example, say a Service Provider requires a CNAME of one of three
values for their users: s01.example.com, s02.example.com, and
s03.example.com.

The value in the template could simply contain %servercluster%, and the
fully qualified string passed in. Alternatively, the value in the
template could contain s%var%.example.com. By placing more fixed data
into the template, the data is more constrained.

Each record will contain the following elements.

[cols=",,,",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Data Element
|Type

|=======================================================================

== Template Considerations

=== Disclosure of Changes and Conflicts

It is left to the discretion of DNS Provider to determine what is disclosed to the user when 
granting permission and/or applying changes to DNS. 

For the synchronous flow this happens while the user is present. One DNS Provider
may decide to simply tell the user the name of the service being enabled. Another
may decide to display the records being set. And another
may progressively display both. 

For conflict detection, some DNS Providers may disclose these and others may not. 
One DNS Provider may simply overwrite
changed records without warning. Another may detect conflicts and warn the users of the
records that will change. And another may implement logic to further
remove any the existing templates that overlap with the new template once applied and disclose these.

As an example, consider a template that sets two records in
DNS (recordA and recordB). Next consider applying a new template that
overlaps with the first template (recordB and recordC). If the DNS
Provider removes conflicting templates when applying new ones, upon
application of the second template the first template would be removed.
This would result in recordA being cleared, and only recordB and recordC
being present in DNS.

Manual changes made by the user at the DNS Provider may also have
appropriate warnings in place to prevent unwanted changes; with
overrides being possible and removal of conflicting templates.

For the asynchronous flow the consent UX is similar. However, the changes are made later
using the API and oAuth. If the DNS Provider choses, it can also detect conflicts and return these
from the API. If the force parameter is set, the changes should be applied regardless of conflicts.

It is ultimately left to the DNS Provider to determine the amount of
disclosure and/or conflict detection. The only requirement is that after
a template is applied the new service is enabled. However, a reasonable
set of recommendations would consist of:

* The consent UX should inform the customer of the service that will be
enabled. Should the customer want to know the specifics, the DNS
Provider could provide a "show details" link to the user. This could
display to them the specific records that are being set in DNS.
* If there are conflicts, either at the template or record level, the
consent UX should warn the user about these conflicts. For templates
this would be services that would be disabled. For records this would be
records that would be overwritten. This could be progressively disclosed

Note: When applying the same template, DNS Providers should not detect
the conflict. Instead the first template would be removed and the new
instance applied. For most templates this is a benign operation.
Unless the template contains variables in host names. For consideration
of this, see the section below.

=== Record Types and Conflicts

A proposed handling of records and conflicts is as follows (if not
otherwise specified, conflicts occur if the records have the same name):

* Replace records of the same type for A, AAAA, MX, CNAME, APEXCNAME,
SRV. If the template specifies an A or AAAA, the respective AAAA or A
record should be removed to avoid IPv4 and IPv6 pointing to different
services
* Append to the existing records of the same type for TXT
** An exception exists for records of unique nature like SPF or DKIM
which should be replaced
* Replace any record for CNAME
* Remove any CNAME record existing at the same or parent level to any
records added by the template

=== Non-essential records

Typically a template specifices a list of DNS records which are required for the service. There may be cases where some records are only required for a very short period of time, and removing or altering the record later (either by the end user or through application of another template) should not trigger conflict detection.

This can be controlled by the <<essential-record, essential>> property of a record in the template.

=== Template Scope

An individual template is scoped to the set of records applied to a
fully qualified domain. This includes the root domain and the host (aka
sub-domain).

As an example if a template is applied on domain=example.com&host=sub1, 
the later application of the template on domain=example.com&host=sub2 will be
treated as a distinct template. Should a conflict be detected later
while applying a template with the records set into "sub2.example.com",
only the records set with this template would be removed.

=== Variables and Host

While templates do allow for variables in a host name, these should
be used very sparingly.

As an example, consider setting up hosting for a site. But instead of
applying the template to a sub-domain, the name of the sub-domain is
placed as a variable in the template.

Such a template might contain an A record of the form:

[source,json]
----
{
	"type": "A",
	"host": "%var%",
	"pointsTo": "2.2.2.2",
	"ttl": 1800
}
----

This template could be applied on a domain like example.com with the var set 
to "sub", "sub1", "sub2", etc.

Application of this template would be at the domain level for
"example.com". This causes problems for application/re-application
of the template, conflict detection, and template removal.

This template would be applied to the domain only, and would remove any
previously applied instances. This means calling this with var=sub
would result in the A record for sub.example.com to be set to 
the value 2.2.2.2. Later applying the template on "example.com" with the
var=sub2 would first remove the old template before setting the new one. Sub.example.com
would be removed, and sub2.example.com would be set to the value
2.2.2.2.

Furthermore, determining conflicts would be impossible when the user is granting consent
for asynchronous operations (oAuth). This is because the host would be indeterminate. 

To solve this problem, templates are applied to a domain and a host 
value. For synchronous operations, the host value is specified in the url.
For asynchronous operations, permissions are granted for specific host values, whose value
is later specified when applying the template.

To allow for the use of the host name or domain name in templates, the
values of %host% and %domain% are available. A third value of %fqdn% is also available. This
value is the result of combining the host and domain name with a trailing period, accounting for 
a potentially empty host.

For example, with domain=example.com&host=, %fqdn% would be <example.com.>, and with
domain=example.com&host=sub1, %fqdn% would be <sub1.example.com.>. Note that we also allow a value of @, 
which is logically equivalent to the %fqdn% variable.

The use of all other variables in the host should be avoided.

Note: There are some templates that utilize CNAME host values containing some form of user 
identification for validation of domain ownership, and these are often passed in variables.

To support this use case, variables are allowed for the host name. But only in this limited circumstance.

It is also recommended that the host name contains some means to assure no conflict with other services or
sub-domains being configured (for example by using a GUID or a constant prefix). 

==== Variables and PointsTo/Target

Variables are also allowed and necessary in the pointsTo in the template. As indicated above, 
consideration is necessary to prevent certain style phishing attacks with the synchronous protocol,
and with the asynchronous protocol when secrets are not present.

The more static the value, the more secure the template. When static values are not possible, a 
carefully crafted link could hijack DNS settings.

The preferred mitigation to this is using signatures with the syncPubKeyDomain field in the
template (for the synchronous protocol), or with secrects (for the asynchronous protocol). 

When this isn't possible, the warnPhishing flag can be set in the template. This tells the DNS
Provider to display warnings to the user before the template is applied.

Domain/host names in a pointsTo/Target implicitly have a trailing dot in the sense of bind. The variables
for %host%, %domain%, %fqdn%, and @ are all available. @ is equivalent to the %fqdn%.

==== Variable Example

Host names specified in a template implicitly contain the host and domain from the parameters. 

As an example, consider the use of the @ (a.k.a. %fqdn%) in both the "host" and in the "pointsTo" in different
records.

Example template:
[source,json]
----
[{
	"type": "CNAME",
	"host": "www",
	"pointsTo": "@",
	"ttl": 1800
},
{
	"type": "A",
	"host": "@",
	"pointsTo": "1.1.1.1",
	"ttl": 1800
}]
----

Template applied with _domain_=foo.com and _host_ parameter missing or empty:

[source]
----
www 1800 IN CNAME foo.com.
@   1800 IN A 1.1.1.1
----

_alternatively_

[source]
----
www.foo.com.    1800 IN CNAME foo.com.
foo.com.        1800 IN A 1.1.1.1
----

Template applied with _domain_=foo.com and _host_=bar:

[source]
----
www.bar 1800 IN CNAME bar.foo.com.
bar     1800 IN A 1.1.1.1
----

_alternatively_

[source]
----
www.bar.foo.com.    1800 IN CNAME foo.com.
bar.foo.com.        1800 IN A 1.1.1.1
----

=== Repository and Integrity

The template format is intended largely for documentation and communication between the DNS Providers and 
Service Providers, and there are no codified endpoints for creation or modification of these objects.
Instead, Domain Connect references a template by ID.

As such, DNS Providers may or may not use templates in this format in
their internal implementations.

However, by defining a standard template format it is believed it will
make it easier for Service Providers to share their configuration across
DNS Providers. Further revisions of this specification may include a
repository for publishing and consuming these templates. For now
templates are maintained at http://domainconnect.org.

Implementers are responsible for data integrity and should use the
record type field to validate that variable input meets the criteria for
each different data type.

Hard-coded host names are the responsibility of the DNS Provider to
protect. That is, DNS Providers are responsible for ensuring that host
names do not interfere with known values (such as m. or www. or mail.)
or internal names that provide critical functionality that is outside
the scope of this specification.

== Extensions/Exclusions

Additional record types and/or extensions to records in the template can
be implemented on a per DNS Provider basis. However, care should be
taken when defining extensions so as to not conflict with other
protocols and standards. Certain record names are reserved for use in
DNS for protocols like DNSSEC (DNSKEY, RRSIG) at the registry level.

Defining these optional extensions in an open manner as part of this
specification is highly recommended. The following are the initial
optional extensions a DNS Provider/Service Provider may support.

==== APEXCNAME

Some Service Providers desire the behavior of a CNAME record, but in the
apex record. This would allow for an A Record at the root of the domain
but dynamically determined at runtime.

The recommended record type for DNS Providers that wish to support this
is an APEXCNAME record. Additional fields included with this record
would include pointsTo and TTL.

Defining a standard for such functionality in DNS is beyond the scope of
this specification. But for DNS Providers that support this
functionality, using the same record type name across DNS Providers
allows template reuse.

==== Redirection

Some Service Providers desire a redirection service associated with the
A Record. A typical example is a service that requires a redirect of the
domain (e.g. example.com) to the www variant (www.example.com). The www
would often contain a CNAME.

Since implementation of a redirection service is typically simple, it is
recommended that service providers implement redirection on their own.
But for DNS Providers that have a redirection service, supporting simple
templates with this functionality may be desired.

While technically not a "record" in DNS, when supporting this optional
functionality it is recommended that this be implemented using two new
record types.

REDIR301 and REDIR302 would implement 301 and 302 redirects
respectively. Associated with this record would be a single field called
the "target", containing the target domain of the redirect.

Setting a REDIR301 or REDIR302 will internally set an A Record on the
domain.

==== Nameservers

Several service providers have asked for functionality supporting an
update to the nameserver records at the registry associated with the
domain.

When implementing this, two records should be provided. NS1 and NS2,
each containing a pointsTo argument.

It will be noted that a nameserver update would require that the DNS
Provider is the registrar. This is not always the case.

This functionality is again deemed as optional and up to the DNS
Provider to determine if they will support this.

==== DS (DNSSEC)

Requests have also been made to allow for updates to the DS record for
DNSSEC. This record is required at the registry to enable DNSSEC, but
can only be written by the registrar.

For DNS Providers that support this record, the record type should be
DS. Values will be keyTag, algorithm, digestType, and digest.

Again it should be noted that a DS update would require that the DNS
Provider is the registrar, and is again deemed as optional and up to the
DNS Provider to determine if they will support.

== Example Templates


===== Example Template
[source,json]
----
{
	"providerId": "example.com",
	"providerName": "Example Web Hosting",
	"serviceId": "hosting",
	"serviceName": "Wordpress by example.com",
	"logoUrl": "https://www.example.com/images/billthecat.jpg",
	"description": "This connects your domain to our super cool web hosting",
	"launchURL" : "https://www.example.com/connectlaunch",
	"records": [
		{
			"groupId" : "service",
			"type": "A",
			"host": "www",
			"pointsTo": "%var1%",
			"ttl": "%var2%"
		},
		{
			"groupId" : "service",
			"type": "A",
			"host": "m",
			"pointsTo": "%var3%",
			"ttl": "%var2%"
		},
		{
			"groupId" : "service",
			"type": "CNAME",
			"host": "webmail",
			"pointsTo": "%var4%",
			"ttl": "%var2%"
		},
		{
			"groupId" : "verification",
			"type": "TXT",
			"host": "example",
			"data": "%var5%",
			"ttl": "%var2%"
		}
	]
}
----

===== Example Records: Single static host record

Consider a template for setting a single host record. The records
section of the template would have a single record of type "A" and could
have a value of:

[source,json]
----
[{
	"type": "A",
	"host": "www",
	"pointsTo": "192.168.1.1",
	"ttl": 600
}]
----

This would have no variable substitution and the application of this
template to a domain would simply set the host name "www" to the IP
address "192.168.1.1"

===== Example Records: Single variable host record for A

In the case of a template for setting a single host record from a
variable, the template would have a single record of type "A" and could
have a value of:

[source,json]
----
[{
	"type": "A",
	"host": "@",
	"pointsTo": "192.168.1.%srv%",
	"ttl": 600
}]
----

A query string with a key/value pair of

[source]
----
srv=2
----

would cause the application of this template to a domain to set the host
name for the apex A record to the IP address "192.168.1.2" with a TTL of
600

===== Example: DNS Zone merging

Consider a DNS Zone before a template application:

[source]
----
$ORIGIN test-domain.com.

@ 3600 IN SOA ns11.acme.net. support.acme.net. 2017050817 7200 1800
1209600 3600
@ 3600 IN NS ns11.acme.net.
@ 3600 IN NS ns12.acme.net.
@ 3600 IN A 1.1.1.1
@ 3600 IN A 1.1.1.2
@ 3600 IN AAAA 2001:db8:1234:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000
@ 3600 IN AAAA 2001:db8:1234:0000:0000:0000:0000:0001
@ 3600 IN MX 10 mx1.acme.net.
@ 3600 IN MX 10 mx2.acme.net.
@ 3600 IN TXT "v=spf1 a include: spf.acme.com ~all"
www 3600 IN CNAME other.host.com.
----

Now application of the following template:

[source,json]
----
[
	{
		"type":"A",
		"host":"@",
		"pointsTo":"2.2.2.2",
		"ttl":"1800"
	},
	{
		"type":"A",
		"host":"www",
		"pointsTo":"2.2.2.2",
		"ttl":"1800"
	},
	{
		"type":"TXT",
		"host":"@",
		"data":"\"v=spf1 a include: spf.hoster.com ~all\"",
		"ttl":"1800"
	}
]
----

The following DNS Zone shall be generated after the template is applied:

[source]
----
$ORIGIN test-domain.com.

@ 3600 IN SOA ns11.acme.net. support.acme.net. 2017050920 7200 1800
1209600 3600
@ 3600 IN NS ns11.acme.net.
@ 3600 IN NS ns12.acme.net.
@ 1800 IN A 2.2.2.2
@ 3600 IN MX 10 mx1.acme.net.
@ 3600 IN MX 10 mx2.acme.net.
@ 1800 IN TXT "v=spf1 a include: spf.hoster.com ~all"
www 1800 IN A 2.2.2.2
----
