<t anchor="_fee13f8f-5eac-227c-11a9-e079a6fccf70">Configuring a service at a Service Provider to work with a domain has historically been a complex task that is difficult for users.</t>

<t anchor="_6cd25dd5-352f-35c6-a83b-5fefcf2e0ef3">Typically, a customer would try to configure their service by entering their domain name with the Service Provider. The Service Provider then used a number of techniques with mixed reliability to discover the DNS Provider. This might include DNS queries for nameservers, queries to whois, and mapping tables to determine the registrar or the company providing DNS.</t>

<t anchor="_d7d7106e-ae4e-7085-67de-05a03095da44">Once the Service Provider discovered the DNS Provider, they typically gave the customer instructions for proper configuration of DNS. This might include help text, screen shots, or even links to the appropriate tools.</t>

<t anchor="_488d2764-49b0-27ab-acfb-918a0ce7d656">Discovery of the DNS Provider in this manner is unreliable, and providing instructions to users would present a number of technologies (DNS record types, TTLs, Hostnames, etc.) and processes they didn't understand. These instructions authored by the Service Provider often quickly become out of date, further confusing the issue for users.</t>

<t anchor="_c34a8cfd-2818-64be-79f2-34bece8e2c8e">The goal of this specificatoin is to create a system where Service Providers can easily enable their applications/services to work with the domain names of their customers. This includes both discovery of the DNS Provider and subsequent modification of DNS.</t>

<t anchor="_dd1a7699-1e73-d0c0-a830-4ae02b55b4b7">The system will be implemented using simple web based interactions and
standard authentication protocols. The creation and modification of DNS
settings will be done through the application of templates instead of
direct manipulation of individual DNS records.</t>

<section anchor="_templates"><name>Templates</name>

<t anchor="_24885499-070b-90aa-2a17-edc766c6a584">Templates are core to Domain Connect, as they fully describe a service owned by
a Service Provider and contain all of the information necessary to
enable and operate/maintain the service in the form of a set of records.</t>

<t anchor="_e0abb55e-75fb-46ea-6036-663ba7cd3959">The individual records in a template may be identified by a groupId. This allows for
the application of templates in different stages. For example, an email
provider might first set a TXT record to verify the domain, and later
set an MX record to configure email delivery. While done separately,
both changes are fundamentally part of the same service.</t>

<t anchor="_0fdb0d1f-7353-9a55-2fc2-db6c6caf5687">Templates may also contain variable portions, as often values of data in
DNS change based on the implementation and/or user of the
service (e.g. the IP address of a service, a customer id,
etc.).</t>

<t anchor="_1bedbd5c-1c60-c3a4-163c-06dcf08aacc6">The template is defined by the Service Provider and manually onboarded with the DNS
Provider, according to a template definition published in
the <xref target="repository-and-integrity">Public Repository</xref> or agreed out-of-band between
the Service Provider and the DNS Provider.</t>

<t anchor="_963a389e-b996-5db6-699a-601198985abb">By basing the protocol on templates instead of DNS Records, several
advantages are achieved. The DNS Provider has very explicit knowledge
and control of the settings being changed to enable a service. And the
system is more secure as templates are controlled and contained.</t>

<t anchor="_aa7d03f5-ab86-8bd2-2154-e27cd7df93d7">To attach a domain name to a service provided by a Service Provider, the customer would first enter their domain name.</t>

<t anchor="_67176c5c-038b-ef33-5259-15f9792e8d66">Instead of relying on examination of the nameservers and mapping these to DNS Providers, DNS Provider discovery is handled through simple records in DNS and an API. The Service Provider queries for a specific record in the zone that returns a REST endpoint to initiate the protocol. When this endpoint is called, a Domain Connect compliant DNS Provider returns information about that domain and how to configure it using Domain Connect.</t>

<t anchor="_e3063abe-6fe7-d623-7705-8c78640d8469">To apply the changes to DNS, there are two use cases. The
first is a synchronous web flow, and the second is an asynchronous flow using OAuth and an API.</t>

<t anchor="_cc2d66fa-3544-0fbe-94c2-a8fb2b714ec7">It is noted that a DNS Provider may choose to only implement one of the flows. As a matter of practice many Service Providers are based on the synchronous flow, with only a handful of them based on the asynchronous OAuth flow. So many DNS providers may opt to only implement the synchronous flow.</t>

<t anchor="_5e487085-cb4a-7fd3-407f-2df89f82cf20">It is also be noted that individual services may work with the synchronous flow only, the asynchronous flow only, or with both.</t>

<t anchor="_1ff3e2e7-40d0-8a6f-debc-e758fca26b32">The asynchronous OAuth flow is tailored for the Service Provider that
wishes to make changes to DNS asynchronously with respect to the user
interaction, or wishes to make multiple or additional changes to DNS
over time.</t>

<t anchor="_5751993e-1492-387e-c711-362ded16227c">The asynchronous flow begins similarly
to the synchronous flow. The Service Provider determines the
DNS Provider and links to a consent dialog at the DNS Provider. Once at
the DNS Provider the user signs in, control of the DNS zone for the domain is
verified, and consent is granted.</t>

<t anchor="_c5ea83f1-dd1c-9a53-62d6-c81c5a247021">Instead of applying the DNS changes on user consent, OAuth access is
granted to the Service Provider. An OAuth access code is generated and
handed back to the Service Provider. The Service Provider then requests
an access (bearer) token.</t>

<t anchor="_83ea585a-7bec-6d67-c92e-d31ef9a2d97a">The permission granted in the OAuth token is a right for the Service
Provider to apply a requested template (or templates) to the specific

<t anchor="_517e544a-65db-e9d1-e5e3-0f36eb2d5344">The Service Provider would later call the API of the DNS provider to apply a template

<t anchor="_07fc1c2b-330c-f8d3-ba25-75c9267498c8">To facilitate discovery of the DNS Provider from a domain name DNS is utilized. This is
done by returning a TXT record for <em>_domainconnect</em> in the zone.</t>

contain a copy of this data in each and every zone. Instead, the DNS
Provider must simply respond to the DNS query for the
<em>_domainconnect</em> TXT record with the appropriate data.</t>

<t anchor="_568d3c19-ee9e-16e9-ecd4-160ba92b11ba">How this is implemented is up to the DNS Provider.</t>

<t anchor="_1b07a19a-ac4d-eb4a-63d7-20b8233b5fe3">For example, the DNS Provider may not store the data inside a TXT record
for the domain, opting instead to put a CNAME in the zone and have the
TXT record in the target of the CNAME. Another DNS Provider may simply
respond with the appropriate records at the DNS layer without having the data in each
zone.</t>

<t anchor="_e824b454-f6ce-5e68-1701-e4f43c15c59c">The URL prefix returned is subsequently used by the Service Provider to
determine the additional settings for using Domain Connect on this

<t anchor="_3349bcb1-0391-d73b-5881-133868886849">Some templates can be called by multiple companies, or be used for different purposes.</t>

<t anchor="_f32000d6-a5da-43f3-a0bb-47a9a7d079ab">For example, most services are sold and provided by the same company. However, some
Service Providers have a reseller channel. This allows the service to be
provided by the Service Provider, but sold through third parties.
It is often this third party reseller that configures DNS.</t>

<t anchor="_f82210cc-ddc5-d07c-01d4-be6ecdf61cd4">While each reseller could enable Domain Connect, this is inefficient for
the DNS Providers. Enabling a single template that is shared by multiple
resellers would be more optimal.</t>

<t anchor="_f01822d8-7fee-1764-93c7-3ce3b6743ab0">As another example, some templates may be used for different purposes by the same company.</t>

<t anchor="_1924be4e-1558-d5d6-8c9c-751e36570bb3">To facilitate these use cases, the ability to pass in additional context for the display
of the providerName and serviceName is enabled. This is only allowed when the template enables the capability
through the sharedProviderName and/or sharedServiceName flags.</t>

<t anchor="_ff09a0f3-6d9d-7269-30bb-8ba594a6fbaa">Note: The shared flag used to be used for this purpose, but has been deprecated.</t>

<t anchor="_a2a7c6aa-11e6-38da-ac13-9f6048c720df">The exact message presented to the user is up to the DNS Provider. However it is recommended
that these fields be used to augment the display of the serviceName and providerName from the template,
not replace it.</t>

<t anchor="_b3b0004d-67dc-774c-0549-60c8c6881cea">Note: When a Service Provider has a large reseller channel, it is highly
recommended that the Service Provider creates an API for their resellers
to ease the implementation of Domain Connect. There are elements of convenience in doing
this around Domain Discovery and URL Formatting. But this would be required
if the template required signatures.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="_verification_of_changes"><name>Verification of Changes</name>

<t anchor="_aa0fd61f-5312-881f-ed33-0e1881963d93">There are circumstances where the Service Provider may wish to verify
that the template was successfully applied. Without Domain Donnect, this
typically involved the Service Provider querying DNS to see if the
changes to DNS had been made.</t>

<t anchor="_0205ee00-4da1-2a9a-1551-27de33371bbc">This same technique works with Domain Connect, and if necessary can be
triggered either manually on the Service Provider site or automatically
upon page/window activation in the browser when the browser window for
the DNS Provider is closed.</t>

<t anchor="_98a0a766-1076-c6ef-42d6-b299b36a3c64">When the redirect_uri is used and an error is not present in the URI,
the Service Provider can not assume the changes were applied to DNS. While true in most
circumstances, users can tamper with or alter the return
url in the browser. As such it is recommend that enablement of a service
be based on verification of changes to DNS.</t>

<t anchor="_698734b8-f258-3237-1039-046accee78e0">Using the OAuth flow is a more advanced use case needed by Service
Providers that have more complex configurations that may require
multiple steps and/or are asynchronous from the user's interaction.</t>

<t anchor="_23aaec6b-0bbb-0f44-be60-46cd42e6460b">Details of an OAuth implementation are beyond the scope of this

Connect is given here.</t>

<t anchor="_ec3fd116-ed47-2cf0-9e1e-e67daca19115">Not all DNS Providers will support the asyncronous flow. As such it is
recommended that Service Providers relying on an OAuth implementation also
implement a synchronous implementation.</t>

<section anchor="_oauth_flow_setup"><name>OAuth Flow: Setup</name>

<t anchor="_61f3ea9f-6ee4-725c-b9f9-e797d80b5573">Service providers wishing to use the OAuth flow must register as an
OAuth client with each DNS provider. This is a manual
process.</t>

<t anchor="_46196909-165c-823b-eb30-c8b6f08d1a8b">To register, the Service Provider would provide (in addition to their
template) any configuration necessary for the DNS Providers OAuth
implementation. This includes valid URLs and Domains for redirects upon
success or errors.</t>

<t anchor="_821c13f0-f14c-99b4-830b-a6d0838d2929">Note: The validity of redirects are very important in any OAuth implementation.
Most OAuth vulnerabilities are a combination of an open redirect and/or a
compromised secret.</t>

<t anchor="_1b09f5b2-700a-2a59-dbd9-13029d8ff136">In return, the DNS provider will give the Service Provider a client id
and a secret which will be used when requesting tokens. For simplicity the client
id should be the same as the providerId.</t>

<t anchor="_593b6e18-f111-16e2-e497-b06ca8d4dc61">To initiate the OAuth flow the Service Provider first links to the DNS
Provider to gain consent.</t>

<t anchor="_11a3a361-3ea7-10d4-a18b-b77110c21ead">This endpoint is similar to the synchronous flow described above. The DNS Provider
must authenticate the user, verify the user has control of the DNS Zone for the domain, and ask the user for
permission. Instead of permission to make a change to DNS, the permission
is now to allow the Service Provider to
make the changes on their behalf. Similarly the
DNS Provider may warn the user that (the eventual)
application of a template might change existing records and/or disrupt
existing services attached to the domain.</t>

<t anchor="_b690b9d2-f0f0-f98b-b60b-5ef8b659f8ad">While the variables for the applied template would be provided later,
the values of some variables may be necessary to determine conflicts. As
such, any variables impacting conflicting records should be provided
in the consent flow. Today this includes variables in hosts, and
variables in the data portion for certain TXT records. As conflict
resolution evolves, this list may grow.</t>

<t anchor="_21daee93-928b-9efa-2dbc-749c9d926ebb">The protocol allows for the Service Provider to gain consent to apply
multiple templates. These templates are specified in the <strong>scope</strong> parameter. It
also allows for the Service Provider to gain consent to apply these templates to the domain
or to the domain with multiple sub-domains. These are specified in the <strong>domain</strong> and <strong>host</strong>
parameter. If conflict detection is implemented
by the DNS Provider, they should account for all permutations.</t>

<t anchor="_abcee595-e582-179c-98da-26e3c52f2ba0">The scope parameter is a space separated list (as per the OAuth protocol)
of the template serviceIds. The host parameter is an OPTIONAL comma separated
list of hosts. A blank entry for the host implies the template can be
applied to the root domain. For example:</t>

<table anchor="_c95bb66b-5c8b-bf8e-d9bf-313cc91305b7"><name>examples of scope and host parameter values in the async flow</name><thead><tr><th align="left"><strong>Query String</strong></th><th align="left"><strong>Description</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">scope=t1+t2=example.com</td><td align="left">Templates "t1" and "t2" can be applied to example.com</td></tr><tr><td align="left">scope=t1+t2=example.com=sub1,sub2</td><td align="left">Templates "t1" and "t2" can be applied to sub1.example.com or sub2.example.com</td></tr><tr><td align="left">scope=t1+t2=example.com=sub1,</td><td align="left">Templates "t1" and "t2" can be applied to example.com or sub1.example.com</td></tr></tbody></table>

<t anchor="_60f7a4db-d6eb-7b77-a6a9-cacf58fd3594">Upon successful authorization/verification/consent from the user, the
DNS Provider will direct the end user's browser to the redirect URI. The
authorization code will be appended to this URI as a query parameter of
"code=" as per the OAuth specification.</t>

<t anchor="_3bebdefc-15a5-497c-83e0-5063a5898d54">Similar to the synchronous flow, upon error the DNS provider may append
an error code as query parameter "error". These errors are also from the
OAuth 2.0 <xref target="RFC6749" section="" relative=""></xref> (4.1.2.1. Error Response - "error" parameter). Valid
values include: invalid_request, unauthorized_client, access_denied,
unsupported_response_type, invalid_scope, server_error, and
temporarilly_unavailable. An OPTIONAL error_description suitable for
developers may also be returned at the discretion of the DNS Provider.
The same considerations as in the synchronous flow apply here.</t>

<t anchor="_fd3a53b5-1703-104b-c1ab-cc0a0adf27b4">The state value passed into the call must be passed back on the query

<t anchor="_584613a1-8c4e-3d84-f073-0c2166e6c400">Once authorization has been granted, the Service Provider must use the
Authorization Code provided to request an Access Token. The OAuth
specification recommends that the Authorization Code be a short lived
token, and a reasonable recommended setting is ten minutes. As such this
exchange needs to be completed before that time has expired or the
process will need to be repeated.</t>

<t anchor="_c2426a1b-f6ab-bd8c-5ca6-de4a6fde5afe">This token exchange is typically done via a server to server API call from the
Service Provider to the DNS Provider using a POST. When called in this manner a
secret is provided
along with the Authorization Code.</t>

<t anchor="_e1561674-fd29-d6e1-ffaa-50eec639abeb">OAuth does allow for retrieving the access token without a secret. This is typically
done when the OAuth client is a client application.
When onboarding with the DNS Provider this would need to be enabled.</t>

<t anchor="_8beeb69f-8a02-7077-9089-22d56fe987a5">When the secret is provided (which is the normal case), care must be taken. A malicious
user could create a domain that returns a false <em>_domainconnect</em> TXT record, and
subsequently a JSON call to their own server for the API end point. By doing so, they
could then run Domain Connect on their domain and retrieve the secret.</t>

<t anchor="_e10321c9-af14-1e4a-d195-fd4696b82083">As such the urlAPI used for OAuth by the Service Provider should be maintained per DNS
Provider and not the value retrieved during discovery.</t>

request for the access token unless otherwise indicated.

important for the client_secret, as passing secrets via a query string

advanced handling of conflicts.</t>

<section anchor="_disclosure_of_changes_and_conflicts"><name>Disclosure of Changes and Conflicts</name>

<t anchor="_8db9b227-7f3f-bb75-61fe-dc094f305cc8">It is left to the discretion of the DNS Provider to determine what is disclosed to the user
when granting permission and/or applying changes to DNS.
This includes disclosing the records being applied and the records
that may be overwritten.</t>

<t anchor="_85c5501f-a4b1-d16f-7574-9caab1336b08">For changes being made, one DNS Provider
may decide to simply tell the user the name of the service being enabled. Another
may decide to display the records being set. And another
may progressively display both.</t>

<t anchor="_b2f552e0-a9e6-43c4-81b5-8278dd26df17">For conflict detection, one DNS Provider may simply overwrite
changed records without warning. Another may detect conflicts and warn the user of the
records that will change. And another may implement logic to further detect, warn, and
remove any of the existing templates that overlap with the new template once applied
(this assumes they are a DNS Provider that maintains template state in DNS).</t>

<t anchor="_e043ef22-d59d-c759-2196-e4ba5f94f9f2">As an example, consider applying a template that sets two records
(recordA and recordB) into a zone. Next consider applying a second template that
overlaps with the first template (recordB and recordC). If the DNS maintains template state
and removes conflicting templates, applying the second template would remove the first
template. Application of the second template would conflict with recordB and the entire
first template would be removed.</t>

<t anchor="_7948e0bf-6950-064d-69f0-46435eaed072">Manual changes made by the user at the DNS Provider may also have
appropriate warnings in place to prevent unwanted changes; with
overrides being possible and removal of conflicting templates.</t>

<t anchor="_ed681040-c672-5c36-d83e-d2c2adb8fbba">For the synchronous flow, this happens while the user is present.</t>

<t anchor="_f08fd71c-d8a8-2fa6-cd05-fa106e452a7c">For the asynchronous flow, the consent UX is similar. However, the changes are made later
using the API and OAuth. The DNS Provider may decide to detect conflicts and
return these from the API without applying the change using the proper response code.
If the force parameter is set, the changes must be applied regardless of conflicts.</t>

<t anchor="_177e91df-034e-eaa2-4a13-a862c1996c11">It is ultimately left to the DNS Provider to determine the amount of
disclosure and/or conflict detection. The only requirement is that after
a template is applied the new records must be applied in totality.</t>

<t anchor="_b9237900-55e8-c463-ebe3-375681847c5e">A reasonable set of recommendations for the UX might consist of:</t>

<ul anchor="_56406cad-8098-a5fe-2a94-9e23a19ca024"><li>The consent UX should inform the customer of the service that will be
enabled. If the customer want to know the specifics, the DNS
Provider could provide a "show details" link to the user. This could
display to them the specific records that are being set in DNS.</li>
<li>If there are conflicts, either at the template or record level, the
consent UX should warn the user about these conflicts. For templates,
this would be services that would be disabled. For records, this would be
records that would be deleted or overwritten. This could be progressively disclosed.</li>

<t anchor="_3f7f6296-a175-58d7-1dca-e16c06a038cc">Conflict detection done by the DNS provider prior to template application has to take

other record type conflict with NS records in the same manner.</li>
<li>MX, SRV records always conflict with records of the same type</li>

<t anchor="_c37c42e0-9a4f-1bf4-bb9f-e32e4dd7cce8">There is an additional consideration for DNS Providers that maintain the state of an applied
template when re-applying a template.</t>

<t anchor="_008301a0-6e10-877e-7501-8604ddc95077">To avoid unnecessary conflict warnings to the user, under normal use when re-applying a
template such a DNS Provider should remove the previously applied template on the same host.</t>

<t anchor="_3bcbb7b8-e234-dba4-0e32-14b21545710e">This may not be desireable for all templates, as a limited set of templates are designed to
be applied multiple times. To faciliate this the template can have the flag <xref target="template-definition">multiInstance</xref>
set. This tells the DNS Provider that the template is expected to be written multiple times
and that a re-apply must not remove previous instances.</t>

<t anchor="_375af312-d39f-8319-ce04-84ae0ad3025f">This setting only impacts DNS Providers that maintain applied template state. DNS Providers

<t anchor="_3aeb38f0-ed2c-099d-a77b-b657ef8becf9">While templates do allow for variables in a host or name field values, these should be used
very sparingly.</t>

<t anchor="_1fb477c6-cced-4161-7f65-730ee61b4e46">As an example, consider setting up hosting for a site. But instead of
applying the template to a domain/host, the name of the host is
placed as a variable in the template.</t>

<t anchor="_a4123deb-cc6f-cb72-1da7-f5696cc758e2">Such a template might contain an A record of the form:</t>

<t anchor="_0cf33909-75f2-0311-285c-6c1626b0c2bf">This template could be applied on a domain like example.com with the var set
to "sub", "sub1", "sub2", etc.</t>

<t anchor="_c28a2685-b694-e21e-f476-ea7fb20d1475">Application of this template would be at the domain level for
"example.com". This causes problems for application/re-application
of the template, conflict detection, and template removal.</t>

<t anchor="_a894eb51-846b-0f72-f8b3-8ecaadb5fb2b">Since this template would be applied to the domain only, DNS providers that maintain
template state would remove previous instances of the template before re-application.
This means applying this template with var=sub
would result in the A record for sub.example.com to be set to
the value 192.0.2.2. Later, applying the template on "example.com" with the
var=sub2 should remove the old template before setting the new one. sub.example.com
would be removed, and sub2.example.com would be set to the value
192.0.2.2.</t>

<t anchor="_7af0364a-28d5-649e-df78-6c560176d325">Furthermore, determining conflicts would be impossible when the user is granting consent
for asynchronous operations (OAuth). This is because the host would be indeterminate.</t>

<t anchor="_39bceb50-bf01-08f5-d188-6c7dedbb65b4">To solve this problem, templates are scoped to a domain and a host
value. For synchronous operations, the host value is specified in the url.
For asynchronous operations, permissions are granted for specific host values, whose value
is later specified when applying the template.</t>

<t anchor="_34216470-292f-1777-cdf2-4c6002c713b6">Note: There are some templates that utilize CNAME or TXT records with host values containing
some form of user identification for validation of domain ownership, and these are often
passed in variables.</t>

<section anchor="_what_is_spf"><name>What is SPF?</name>

<t anchor="_1cacd893-f110-363a-0f85-ce105178e048">SPF stands for Sender Policy Framework specified in
<xref target="RFC7208" section="" relative=""></xref>. It is a
record that specifies a list of authorized host names and/or IP addresses from which mail
can originate from for a given domain name.</t>

<t anchor="_7a24992f-ef53-cc61-9bb8-abeb8e1af5f3">It manifests itself as a TXT record.  The format of which starts with v=spf1 followed by a list of "rules" of
what to include/exclude.  If a rule passes, the mail is allowed. If it fails, it moves to the next rule.
Typical record might appear as:</t>

<sourcecode anchor="_5f39bbe8-2204-9f33-cc64-58dc1b089ecb"><![CDATA[v=spf1 include:policy.exampleprovider.example -all]]></sourcecode>


<t anchor="_1ef0da64-71ce-e9c5-1031-b87b87b3807a">This is an SPF record with two rules.  The first rule indicates that the rules for SPF record
<em>policy.exampleprovider.example be included in this record. The second rule is a catch all (_all</em>). The default modifier for a rule is <em>pass</em> (+). Other modifiers are <em>hard failure</em>(-), <em>soft failure</em> (~) and <em>neutral</em> (?).</t>

<t anchor="_4eb75087-44d1-11a4-fd0b-c67320df5260">Note: A failure in SPF doesn't mean delivery won't happen, however depending on the policies of the receiving
system, messages classified with <em>hard failure</em> or <em>soft failure</em> may not be delivered or marked as spam.</t>

<t anchor="_6b834557-b42f-ba6d-c68a-a2892ef2dcae">The use of "all" at the end  is pretty common, although some providers mark it as ~ (soft fail) or ? (neutral).
The reality is that a good SPF record is tuned based on what services are attached to a domain. Not just one
individual service.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="multiple-services"><name>Multiple Services</name>

<t anchor="_0a0e9221-4692-74ee-3252-e8b7512c480d">If only one email sending service were active, the SPF record recommended by the provider is sufficient. But
mail from a domain can often come from several different services.</t>

<t anchor="_87fbf50f-e588-d3a0-a9f2-e2ed095b62c5">A very typical use case might be end user mail and an email newsletter service.
Let's look at the SPF records recommended for individual services.</t>

<t anchor="_b86ef6be-e92a-8637-3204-ae7ae79ea4f8">Mailer1: v=spf1 include:spf.mailer1.example -all
Newsletter1: v=spf1 include:_spf.newsletter.example ~all</t>

<t anchor="_97a1a3f3-5a70-a30d-06b2-b7df7f0e75fd">All of these examples use the include syntax. This is fairly common. The use of all at the end is common,
although is often inconsistent with the modifier.</t>

<t anchor="_a27d1a7b-1b46-677a-3a4c-3ce481479408">If a customer installed Mailer1 and Newsletter1, their combined SPF record ought to be something like:</t>

<sourcecode anchor="_d85934fa-4a6d-ee35-4227-e6e48188be04"><![CDATA[v=spf1 include:spf.mailer1.example include:_spf.newsletter.example
 ~all]]></sourcecode>


<t anchor="_5dff0a3d-cf4d-595f-89c3-6a38025d94b6">We combined the two rules, and in this case picked the least restrictive all modifier.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="_spf_record_merging"><name>SPF Record Merging</name>

<t anchor="_e5a00c59-fdfd-9adb-fa4e-e8b535e148e0">The challenge with SPF records and Domain Connect is that an individual service might recommend an SPF record. If only one service were active, this would be accurate. But with several services together only the DNS Provider is able to determine the valid shape of a SPF TXT record.</t>

<t anchor="_6549db41-1747-2db1-a7cd-9a34ecba2c07">One solution to this problem is to merge all related records. At the highest level, this means taking everything between the "v=spf1" and the "all" from each of the records and merging them together, terminating with hard-coded modifier on <em>all</em> at the end.  For an SPF record to fulfill it's purpose of protection against malicious email delivery, Domain Connect advises a fixed modifier <em>"~"</em> advising lower rating of the messages from other sources not specified in SPF. This setup offers a reasonable level of protection of mail delivery, on the other side does not reject the message in case forwarding facility is in place.</t>

<sourcecode anchor="_f05e4bef-5968-bfc3-758c-a6fe985d859f"><![CDATA[@ TXT v=spf1 include:spf.mailer1.example include:_spf.newsletter.exam
ple ~all]]></sourcecode>


<t anchor="_e1a05ef9-cb9e-2634-8fba-87e4ef3b8af1">The other would be to write intermediate records, and reference these locally.</t>

<sourcecode anchor="_ba8c0d20-f366-c81e-8613-fce5005bd8ac"><![CDATA[r1.example.com. TXT v=spf1 include:spf.mailer1.example ~all

@ TXT v=spf1 include:r1.example.com include:r2.example.com ~all]]></sourcecode>


<t anchor="_9960ba23-b1d3-f5a5-021b-136f2fdca440">There are advantages and disadvantages to both approaches.  SPF records have a limit of 10 DNS lookups and record length is limited to 255 characters.  So depending on the embedded records both approaches might have advantages.</t>

<t anchor="_3506ab8e-a076-95b6-da7b-ea266e82990d">The implementation would be left to the DNS Provider, but to facilitate this SPF records must NOT be included in templates.  Instead, we introduce a new pseudo-record type in the template called <em>SPFM</em>. This has the following attribute:</t>

<dl anchor="_661f62fd-6ae2-ae70-43ed-64bd5b7bc023"><dt>spfRules</dt><dd><t anchor="_5e12d990-5875-45f0-866e-083e9a0c32e9">Determines the desired rules, basically everything but leading "v=spf1" and trailing <em>all</em> rule -  see: <xref target="template-record">SPF Rules</xref></t>
</dd></dl>

<t anchor="_33d099eb-5bed-c885-fdf0-5e28b14645e7">When a template is added or removed with an <em>SPFM</em> record in the template, some code would need to take the aggregate value of all <em>SPFM</em> records in all templates applied as well as existing SPF TXT record on the host and recalculate the resulting SPF TXT record. In case several sources specify the same rule with a different policy DNS Provider SHOULD apply the least restrictive one as a result. <em>soft failure</em> SHOULD be preferred over <em>hard failure</em>, <em>neutral</em> SHOULD be preferred over <em>soft failure</em>.</t>

<t anchor="_c55eb9cc-49c6-9a24-96df-4dc16f892a00">DNS Provider SHOULD also allow the end user to modify the SPF record after merging.</t>

<t anchor="_cbc1c114-a3e3-b337-c17f-b2ea3e6656a1">Due to merging step in between, the resulting SPF TXT records are considered non-essential (see: <xref target="non-essential-record"></xref>). That means the user may decide to override the final calculated value or remove the whole SPF record. This action must not lead to removal of any related templates in conflict detection and template integrity routines if implemented by the DNS provider.</t>

<t anchor="_ba6a0236-cbe9-04ee-def2-dc36b223aacd">If the existing TXT record makes the merging operation not possible, the DNS provider must handle this situation the same way as a conflict and either let the end-user resolve it in the UX (both in Synchronous and Asynchronous flow) or return the conflict as an error in the Asynchronous flow unless the <em>force=true</em> parameter is used, effectively removing the existing record.</t>

<t anchor="_5eab9d17-d380-2a94-e7c9-bc82693d4b0f">Service providers should avoid exact match checking content of TXT SPF record, as it might be strongly influenced by the DNS Provider merging strategy and user actions.</t>

would include pointsTo and TTL.</t>

<t anchor="_838f6cf3-301d-8532-840b-79cc6cf4bc11">Defining a standard for such functionality in DNS is beyond the scope of
this specification. But for DNS Providers that support this
functionality, using the same record type name across DNS Providers
allows template reuse.</t>

<section anchor="_redirection"><name>Redirection</name>

<t anchor="_ec1d85bd-5681-186b-ee3a-aef524763b95">Some Service Providers desire a redirection service associated with the
A Record. A typical example is a service that requires a redirect of the
domain (e.g. example.com) to the www variant (www.example.com). The www
would often contain a CNAME.</t>

<t anchor="_2633c35b-10d6-1752-abbd-68b9741858ed">Since implementation of a redirection service is typically simple, it is
recommended that service providers implement redirection on their own.
But for DNS Providers that have a redirection service, supporting simple
templates with this functionality may be desired.</t>

<t anchor="_1c6be30c-9482-8d3d-0852-71099c006810">While technically not a "record" in DNS, when supporting this OPTIONAL
functionality it is recommended that this should be implemented using two new
record types.</t>

<t anchor="_4a246beb-f57e-9f42-cad9-b6e14529db07">REDIR301 and REDIR302 would implement 301 and 302 redirects
respectively. Associated with this record would be a single field called
the "target", containing the target url of the redirect.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="_nameservers"><name>Nameservers</name>

<t anchor="_6d2409e8-02a1-4b0c-2b37-ebfc4f5b5987">Several service providers have asked for functionality supporting an
update to the nameserver records at the registry associated with the
domain.</t>

<t anchor="_712820e4-573d-9670-d99b-8b20fec154c5">When implementing this, two records should be provided. NS1 and NS2,
each containing a pointsTo argument.</t>

<t anchor="_ddbe7577-ee13-fc54-38c1-9703c1e4a8bb">It will be noted that a nameserver update would require that the DNS
Provider is the registrar. This is not always the case.</t>

<t anchor="_ad7f8896-6c66-8364-08be-d75a3616e3f9">This functionality is again deemed as OPTIONAL and up to the DNS
Provider to determine if they will support this.</t>

<section anchor="_ds_dnssec"><name>DS (DNSSEC)</name>

<t anchor="_fdcb8dfa-0af7-4564-edac-0e4b2d909666">Requests have been made to allow for updates to the DS record for
DNSSEC. This record is required at the registry to enable DNSSEC, but
can only be written by the registrar.</t>

<t anchor="_2a9651dd-cbaf-be10-23af-dfc7472c925e">For DNS Providers that support this record, the record type should be
DS. Values will be keyTag, algorithm, digestType, and digest.</t>

<t anchor="_c95d6fda-1679-e9ed-57f9-cd8cce4820f9">Again it should be noted that a DS update would require that the DNS
