    <section anchor="_introduction"><name>Introduction</name>

<t anchor="_ee2be90c-9a4b-533a-12ab-112def3bf89c">Connecting a domain name to a service should be a simple and straightforward process.  However, historically, users have faced a complex and often frustrating task involving manual DNS configuration.  Traditional methods are unreliable, require deep technical knowledge of DNS, and result in outdated and confusing instructions from Service Providers.  This leads to user frustration, support overhead, and abandoned setups.</t>

<t anchor="_09308fcb-e6d5-259e-3bd6-512b799d99fd">To address these challenges, Domain Connect offers a streamlined and automated solution.  It empowers Service Providers to easily enable their services to work with user domains, simplifying both DNS provider discovery and DNS configuration.  By abstracting away the complexities of manual DNS management through user-friendly web interactions, standard authentication, and template-based configurations, Domain Connect significantly improves the user experience.</t>

<section anchor="_primary_use_cases"><name>Primary Use Cases</name>

<t anchor="_5da5f986-b3fc-5995-cdd3-6c62bb2ff85e">The following use cases illustrate the wide range of applications where Domain Connect simplifies and automates DNS configuration, from basic service onboarding to complex, dynamic DNS management scenarios.</t>

<ul anchor="_f9c2b312-ceac-485b-9ec4-84e0429c6739"><li><strong>SaaS Provider with One-Off DNS Configuration:</strong> A Software as a Service (SaaS) Provider offering functionality with an option to assign own domain name, such as web hosting or email, can utilize Domain Connect to streamline the process of configuring DNS records for their customers. This automation eliminates the need for manual configuration and simplifies the onboarding experience for users.</li>
<li><strong>SaaS Provider with Multi-Step DNS Configuration:</strong> Some SaaS Providers may require a multi-step DNS configuration process, potentially involving asynchronous operations. For example, a service might require initial verification of domain ownership through a TXT record, followed by the creation of CNAME records for different subdomains. Domain Connect can handle such scenarios by utilizing its asynchronous flow. This allows the Service Provider to obtain user consent and apply the necessary DNS changes in multiple steps, even if the user is not actively present during the entire process.</li>
<li><strong>On-Premise Service with Publicly Accessible DNS Service:</strong> An on-premise service, such as a local network device or server, can also benefit from Domain Connect if it utilizes a publicly accessible DNS service. By leveraging Domain Connect, the service can automatically update DNS records as needed, ensuring that the service remains accessible through its domain name.</li>
<li><strong>Tool or Service with Regularly Updated DNS Entries:</strong> A tool or service that requires regular updates to DNS entries, such as a dynamic DNS service or a DNS-based load balancer, can use Domain Connect to automate the process.</li>
<li><strong>Packaged Software Provider:</strong> A packaged software provider, whether open-source or proprietary, can integrate Domain Connect into their installation and configuration process. This allows the software to automatically configure necessary DNS records during installation, simplifying the setup process for users. However, if the software is installed on a private network with a private DNS service, it might not be directly compatible with Domain Connect, unless the DNS service provides Domain Connect endpoints accessible to the installation process.</li>
</ul>

<t anchor="_b989b2ac-e167-7fbf-c972-0c211c4509ce">While Domain Connect offers significant advantages in automating DNS configuration, it's important to recognize scenarios where it might not be the ideal solution:</t>

<ul anchor="_acecd7a0-e852-9868-7abc-27a1f7888c64"><li><strong>Automation or CI/CD Pipelines:</strong> Domain Connect is primarily designed for user-driven DNS configuration, where an end user grants consent and applies changes. Automating this process within CI/CD pipelines or other automated workflows can be challenging, as it requires obtaining and securely storing OAuth tokens beforehand. However, if authorisation tokens are pre-obtained from a user-driven setup process, Domain Connect can be also integrated into automation workflows.</li>
<li><strong>Private/Enterprise DNS with Public SaaS Providers:</strong> Domain Connect relies on public DNS records and endpoints to facilitate discovery and configuration. If a private or enterprise DNS service is used, it might not be directly compatible with Domain Connect, unless the DNS service provides publicly accessible Domain Connect endpoints.</li>

<section anchor="_templates"><name>Templates</name>

<t anchor="_1280b059-1cb4-518f-3065-fdbeec3e6142">Templates are core to Domain Connect, as they fully describe a service owned by a Service Provider and contain all of the information necessary to enable and operate/maintain the service in the form of a set of records.</t>

<t anchor="_c48e1711-a93d-9400-f883-f55033d0f8c7">The individual records in a template may be identified by a groupId. This allows for the application of templates in different stages. For example, an email provider might first set a TXT record to verify the domain, and later set an MX record to configure email delivery. While done separately, both changes are fundamentally part of the same service.</t>

<t anchor="_fdac537b-8d1c-a1f9-45b9-e34c425c6101">Templates may also contain variable portions, as often values of data in DNS change based on the implementation and/or user of the service (e.g. the IP address of a service, a textual unique token, etc.).</t>

<t anchor="_ee53bb7f-7ef9-ca93-727f-eff8e4cf66e3">The template is defined by the Service Provider and manually onboarded with the DNS Provider, according to a template definition published in the <xref target="repository-and-integrity">Public Repository</xref> or agreed out-of-band between the Service Provider and the DNS Provider.</t>

<section anchor="_trust_model"><name>Trust Model</name>

<t anchor="_e703e674-9a8b-7365-e9c5-6f1334234182">The Domain Connect protocol relies on a robust trust model to ensure the security and reliability of DNS configuration delegation between Service Providers and DNS Providers.  This model addresses the necessary trust relationships between users, Service Providers, and DNS Providers, centering on secure template utilization and DNS Provider vetting processes.</t>

<section anchor="_trust_establishment"><name>Trust Establishment</name>

<t anchor="_1878a7ec-e438-771b-2266-99224eb23df2">User trust in the DNS Provider is an essential factor. DNS Provider is a trusted party by the fact that DNS Provider has full technical access to the DNS zone already. Users depend on their DNS Providers to accurately reflect DNS record modifications initiated through Domain Connect. Consequently, DNS Providers are expected implement authorization checks to validate user permissions prior to enacting any DNS zone changes. Furthermore, DNS Providers are responsible for translating template specifications into a human-readable format, enabling users to readily comprehend the nature and impact of proposed DNS record changes.</t>

<t anchor="_458b2116-ddc6-02dc-bc1e-0477836f515c">Users would typically place trust in Service Providers to act responsibly and only make DNS modifications that are within the scope defined by the approved template, however it shall be observed that a malicious actor may try to exploit this trust by acting as a benign Service Provider or building a fake one, therefore by default Service Provider shall not be assumed to be a trusted party in the protocol considerations.</t>

<t anchor="_ad89acf1-a696-fb1a-befc-02c559e9f4b1">A foundational element to close this gap is the establishment of trust between DNS Providers and Service Providers. DNS Providers verify the legitimacy and security of templates provided by Service Providers as well as they are able to verify textual information included in the template and provided to the user, such as provider name or service name. This trust is typically established through an onboarding process which may involve contractual agreements or appropriate template acceptance policies.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="_template_security"><name>Template Security</name>

<t anchor="_311176b1-d423-81fc-ae3f-923e52a07b4a">Templates are central to the trust model, defining the permitted scope of DNS zone modifications and restricting Service Provider actions, preventing unauthorized changes beyond the template's specified parameters. The template defines the types of DNS records within the zone and together with a distinct domain name and optionally sub-domain with user consent it defines clearly the part of the zone that the Service Provider is authorized to modify via the template application. Service Providers create templates which are then onboarded by DNS Providers, either adhering to a published template definition or based on bilateral agreements. The DNS Provider has very explicit knowledge and control of the settings being changed to enable a service.</t>

<t anchor="_e2661e51-6f6f-87f2-87fc-be1f3d1aa468">To attach a domain name to a service provided by a Service Provider, the user would first enter their domain name.</t>

<t anchor="_8cdbf3a4-9368-9fc3-5306-0c88627d486b">Instead of relying on examination of the nameservers and mapping these to DNS Providers, DNS Provider discovery is handled through simple records in DNS and an API. The Service Provider queries for a specific record in the zone that returns a REST endpoint to initiate the protocol. When this endpoint is called, a Domain Connect compliant DNS Provider returns information about that domain and how to configure it using Domain Connect.</t>

<t anchor="_c75c8b85-3557-10a3-2c19-19c103e2460c">To apply the changes to DNS, there are two use cases. The first is a synchronous web flow, and the second is an asynchronous flow using OAuth and an API.</t>

<t anchor="_e0ca0ec5-8666-ec4b-045d-4a9ae57cbb89">It is noted that a DNS Provider MAY choose to only implement one of the flows, however it is RECOMMENDED to implement Synchronous Flow which fulfill needs of most Service Providers.</t>

<t anchor="_23d0500c-5c3c-86ce-1252-477ec7fa3adb">Individual Service Providers MAY work with the synchronous flow only, the asynchronous flow only, or with both.</t>

<t anchor="_e74f9a97-8bb3-2757-bb9c-bebe54a20abc">For example, most services are sold and provided by the same company. However, some
Service Providers have a reseller channel. This allows the service to be

It is often this third party reseller that configures DNS.</t>

<t anchor="_70b6b290-3183-d52d-ec12-fa338325427a">While each reseller could enable Domain Connect, this is inefficient for
the DNS Providers. Enabling a single template that is shared by multiple
resellers would be more optimal.</t>

<t anchor="_6e8c1d37-cbeb-eb68-c859-cc9c1d559a9e">As another example, some templates may be used for different purposes by the same company.</t>

<t anchor="_9ea1d88d-13a0-6653-38d3-dc9326207697">To facilitate these use cases, the ability to pass in additional context for the display

through the sharedProviderName and/or sharedServiceName flags.</t>

<t anchor="_7f6ea6f3-2803-323d-c86a-76423a569844">Note: The shared flag used to be used for this purpose, but has been deprecated.</t>

<t anchor="_55500432-b820-5352-7ca1-7c7d302c7538">The exact message presented to the user is up to the DNS Provider. However it is recommended
that these fields be used to augment the display of the serviceName and providerName from the template,
not replace it.</t>

<t anchor="_f7f3c2cb-5b6b-c426-bf02-23b34502f168">Note: When a Service Provider has a large reseller channel, it is highly
recommended that the Service Provider creates an API for their resellers
to ease the implementation of Domain Connect. There are elements of convenience in doing
this around Domain Discovery and URL Formatting. But this would be required
if the template required signatures.</t>

<section anchor="_verification_of_changes"><name>Verification of Changes</name>

<t anchor="_d7416747-2d4e-ce38-d5a1-67b164f608dc">There are circumstances where the Service Provider may wish to verify
that the template was successfully applied. Without Domain Donnect, this
typically involved the Service Provider querying DNS to see if the
changes to DNS had been made.</t>

<t anchor="_aedfc2ff-9dd0-a75a-37f6-a9d309607df5">This same technique works with Domain Connect, and if necessary can be
triggered either manually on the Service Provider site or automatically
upon page/window activation in the browser when the browser window for
the DNS Provider is closed.</t>

<t anchor="_c7c1b36e-caf6-f365-0994-43527cc49749">When the redirect_uri is used and an error is not present in the URI,
the Service Provider can not assume the changes were applied to DNS. While true in most
circumstances, users can tamper with or alter the return
url in the browser. As such it is recommend that enablement of a service
be based on verification of changes to DNS.</t>

<t anchor="_2252ab3e-b17e-33dd-1a38-e0ea55c4d63c">To register, the Service Provider would provide (in addition to their

<t anchor="_6b157699-927b-da23-a052-d67d92e6f1c9">Note: The validity of redirects are very important in any OAuth implementation.

compromised secret.</t>

<t anchor="_f3cc3689-c101-9941-28f4-7fb1304acd4c">In return, the DNS provider will give the Service Provider a client id

<t anchor="_7b8847ac-2979-1e0d-89d0-6bb76e9958b6">This endpoint is similar to the synchronous flow described above. The DNS Provider
must authenticate the user, verify the user has control of the DNS Zone for the domain, and ask the user for
permission. Instead of permission to make a change to DNS, the permission
is now to allow the Service Provider to
make the changes on their behalf. Similarly the
DNS Provider may warn the user that (the eventual)
application of a template might change existing records and/or disrupt
existing services attached to the domain.</t>

<t anchor="_abc9fb32-5a1b-bef2-62fb-511324647d12">While the variables for the applied template would be provided later,
the values of some variables may be necessary to determine conflicts. As
such, any variables impacting conflicting records should be provided
in the consent flow. Today this includes variables in hosts, and
variables in the data portion for certain TXT records. As conflict
resolution evolves, this list may grow.</t>

<t anchor="_d9438b35-bcc0-6c68-1ebf-dd07225ba924">The protocol allows for the Service Provider to gain consent to apply
multiple templates. These templates are specified in the <strong>scope</strong> parameter. It
also allows for the Service Provider to gain consent to apply these templates to the domain
or to the domain with multiple sub-domains. These are specified in the <strong>domain</strong> and <strong>host</strong>
parameter. If conflict detection is implemented
by the DNS Provider, they should account for all permutations.</t>

<t anchor="_04ba57ee-df97-6cd0-105e-e058e2dd2ccb">The scope parameter is a space separated list (as per the OAuth protocol)
of the template serviceIds. The host parameter is an OPTIONAL comma separated

<sourcecode anchor="_4c9f424b-fae6-f2b9-ad8d-af88f34e0ec9"><![CDATA[POST

<t anchor="_3812db22-4f22-b889-9760-83b22c2eefbc">Once authorization has been granted, the Service Provider must use the
Authorization Code provided to request an Access Token. The OAuth
specification recommends that the Authorization Code be a short lived
token, and a reasonable recommended setting is ten minutes. As such this
exchange needs to be completed before that time has expired or the
process will need to be repeated.</t>

<t anchor="_73ee474d-5765-85a7-e749-77c86f5d342c">This token exchange is typically done via a server to server API call from the
Service Provider to the DNS Provider using a POST. When called in this manner a
secret is provided
along with the Authorization Code.</t>

<t anchor="_b0d955cc-8f49-9e5b-5e02-6d58d314a356">OAuth does allow for retrieving the access token without a secret. This is typically
done when the OAuth client is a client application.
When onboarding with the DNS Provider this would need to be enabled.</t>

<t anchor="_3f09a3f7-9bc3-ef21-027a-cd93ad232a5d">When the secret is provided (which is the normal case), care must be taken. A malicious
user could create a domain that returns a false <em>_domainconnect</em> TXT record, and
subsequently a JSON call to their own server for the API end point. By doing so, they
could then run Domain Connect on their domain and retrieve the secret.</t>

<t anchor="_04022a20-a863-844b-a40c-8cc22b9f801c">As such the urlAPI used for OAuth by the Service Provider should be maintained per DNS
Provider and not the value retrieved during discovery.</t>

<t anchor="_6a03b80a-ed7f-68c5-8c33-20336e36888d">The following table describes the POST parameters that must be included in the
request for the access token unless otherwise indicated.
The parameters should be accepted via the
query string or the body of the post. This is again particularly
important for the client_secret, as passing secrets via a query string
is generally frowned upon given that various systems often log URLs.</t>

<t anchor="_1df4bf9c-4c9a-4e60-70ec-074d1d8f5fc8">DNS Providers may chose to maintain state inside records in DNS indicating the templates
writing the records. Other providers may chose to not maintain this state.</t>

<t anchor="_260ba6d5-a23c-0c22-4b55-91a53d737dd5">A DNS Provider that maintains this state may be able to provide an improved experience for

advanced handling of conflicts.</t>

<t anchor="_cc977f71-9ee4-4ce6-f3b2-b61fb072973c">To make the implementation burden reasonable for DNS Providers, Domain Connect does not dictate the approach.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="_disclosure_of_changes_and_conflicts"><name>Disclosure of Changes and Conflicts</name>

<t anchor="_03e3eb18-dfa9-1826-818d-bcff89c92b0c">It is left to the discretion of the DNS Provider to determine what is disclosed to the user
when granting permission and/or applying changes to DNS.
This includes disclosing the records being applied and the records
that may be overwritten.</t>

<t anchor="_e7570b56-0ca1-fc52-91d2-b4937a573cfa">For changes being made, one DNS Provider
may decide to simply tell the user the name of the service being enabled. Another
may decide to display the records being set. And another
may progressively display both.</t>

<t anchor="_dfe4f6d1-9572-78ba-fa0f-b10b98885ac0">For conflict detection, one DNS Provider may simply overwrite
changed records without warning. Another may detect conflicts and warn the user of the
records that will change. And another may implement logic to further detect, warn, and
remove any of the existing templates that overlap with the new template once applied
(this assumes they are a DNS Provider that maintains template state in DNS).</t>

<t anchor="_dcd1e973-06d5-2a0e-4720-644d16296094">As an example, consider applying a template that sets two records
(recordA and recordB) into a zone. Next consider applying a second template that
overlaps with the first template (recordB and recordC). If the DNS maintains template state
and removes conflicting templates, applying the second template would remove the first
template. Application of the second template would conflict with recordB and the entire
first template would be removed.</t>

<t anchor="_d2359d04-5882-0d81-9844-09a42e0fa175">Manual changes made by the user at the DNS Provider may also have
appropriate warnings in place to prevent unwanted changes; with
overrides being possible and removal of conflicting templates.</t>

<t anchor="_eea930df-b43f-7faf-4101-6918aa75e856">For the synchronous flow, this happens while the user is present.</t>

<t anchor="_6a6cf268-4c44-fbac-2058-d00860ee6c3d">For the asynchronous flow, the consent UX is similar. However, the changes are made later
using the API and OAuth. The DNS Provider may decide to detect conflicts and
return these from the API without applying the change using the proper response code.
If the force parameter is set, the changes must be applied regardless of conflicts.</t>

<t anchor="_2c2cdb13-c5ef-b00a-250c-9c24ef7b3b8d">It is ultimately left to the DNS Provider to determine the amount of
disclosure and/or conflict detection. The only requirement is that after
a template is applied the new records must be applied in totality.</t>

<t anchor="_891279ba-6fab-bb45-93f9-53229e46b8b5">A reasonable set of recommendations for the UX might consist of:</t>

<ul anchor="_47a9050b-0117-5467-3e46-0a552ad49c03"><li>The consent UX should inform the user of the service that will be
enabled. If the user want to know the specifics, the DNS
Provider could provide a "show details" link to the user. This could
display to them the specific records that are being set in DNS.</li>
<li>If there are conflicts, either at the template or record level, the
consent UX should warn the user about these conflicts. For templates,
this would be services that would be disabled. For records, this would be
records that would be deleted or overwritten. This could be progressively disclosed.</li>
</ul>

<t anchor="_37600970-73db-9317-e98a-ebdffe48c5d1">Conflict detection done by the DNS provider prior to template application has to take
into consideration specifics of each DNS record type. The rules outlined below
ensure predictable conflict resolution between DNS providers. Each rule applies to

other record type conflict with NS records in the same manner.</li>
<li>MX, SRV records always conflict with records of the same type</li>
<li>A and AAAA records conflict with any other A and/or AAAA record, to avoid IPv4
and IPv6 pointing to different services.</li>

<t anchor="_bd70d59c-90fa-c165-46fc-8a6527d982eb">There is an additional consideration for DNS Providers that maintain the state of an applied
template when re-applying a template.</t>

<t anchor="_29368541-8636-ba8a-1eff-0dca3f7d07f6">To avoid unnecessary conflict warnings to the user, under normal use when re-applying a
template such a DNS Provider should remove the previously applied template on the same host.</t>

<t anchor="_628210ab-e82e-9dbc-5642-34093207d597">This may not be desireable for all templates, as a limited set of templates are designed to
be applied multiple times. To faciliate this the template can have the flag <xref target="template-definition">multiInstance</xref>
set. This tells the DNS Provider that the template is expected to be written multiple times
and that a re-apply MUST NOT remove previous instances.</t>

<t anchor="_0cf3fbc7-aa93-7c59-755a-b56cd74adb7e">This setting only impacts DNS Providers that maintain applied template state. DNS Providers
that do not maintain applied template state must rely on the normal conflict
resolution rules, and this flag has no impact.</t>

<section anchor="non-essential-record"><name>Non-essential records</name>

<t anchor="_80e0760b-e2ae-961c-d799-577e12fc5543">Typically a template specifies a list of DNS records which are required for the service.
There may be cases where some records are only required for a very short period of time,
and removing or altering the record later (either by the end user or through application
of another template) should not trigger conflict detection.</t>

<t anchor="_9b22276f-f895-5d21-dc98-c2bafb12a264">This can be controlled by the <xref target="template-record">essential</xref> property of a record in
the template.</t>

<section anchor="_template_scope"><name>Template Scope</name>

<t anchor="_745ccf90-a182-6193-6f48-1b9d5506b09b">For DNS Providers that maintain template state, an individual template is scoped to the set of records applied to a
fully qualified domain. This includes the root domain and the host (aka
sub-domain) at apply time.</t>

<t anchor="_02059171-5ca5-ba47-7ef5-6cce27910c67">As an example, if a template is applied on domain=example.com=sub1
a later application of the template on domain=example.com=sub2 must be
treated as a distinct template. If a conflict is detected later

<t anchor="_c3e5e255-0791-636f-a536-3396cd1ca8d5">Application of this template would be at the domain level for

of the template, conflict detection, and template removal.</t>

<t anchor="_b8af17d2-10a0-2f73-fe29-e271857fa562">Since this template would be applied to the domain only, DNS providers that maintain
template state would remove previous instances of the template before re-application.
This means applying this template with var=sub
would result in the A record for sub.example.com to be set to
the value 192.0.2.2. Later, applying the template on "example.com" with the
var=sub2 should remove the old template before setting the new one. sub.example.com
would be removed, and sub2.example.com would be set to the value
192.0.2.2.</t>

<t anchor="_3bf7fadf-b952-f6f5-f44a-862469d0a6c9">Furthermore, determining conflicts would be impossible when the user is granting consent

<t anchor="_8c9f05e8-dc27-2556-6bf0-42c2bad5c74e">To solve this problem, templates are scoped to a domain and a host
value. For synchronous operations, the host value is specified in the url.
For asynchronous operations, permissions are granted for specific host values, whose value
is later specified when applying the template.</t>

<t anchor="_470b9fa2-f83a-5560-d6df-f48ab3c186ea">Note: There are some templates that utilize CNAME or TXT records with host values containing

<section anchor="_what_is_spf"><name>What is SPF?</name>

<t anchor="_fb6d156a-bd93-1842-f2fc-990e6b72036d">SPF stands for Sender Policy Framework specified in
<xref target="RFC7208" section="" relative=""></xref>. It is a
record that specifies a list of authorized host names and/or IP addresses from which mail
can originate from for a given domain name.</t>

<t anchor="_5d620680-60a3-49b2-4412-4ad9248617ab">It manifests itself as a TXT record.  The format of which starts with v=spf1 followed by a list of "rules" of
what to include/exclude.  If a rule passes, the mail is allowed. If it fails, it moves to the next rule.
Typical record might appear as:</t>

<sourcecode anchor="_82d58131-5b2d-10d4-6b2c-8b8fe28ade03"><![CDATA[v=spf1 include:policy.exampleprovider.example -all]]></sourcecode>


<t anchor="_202f554d-2725-2728-69cb-ac2272d116db">This is an SPF record with two rules.  The first rule indicates that the rules for SPF record
<em>policy.exampleprovider.example be included in this record. The second rule is a catch all (_all</em>). The default modifier for a rule is <em>pass</em> (+). Other modifiers are <em>hard failure</em>(-), <em>soft failure</em> (~) and <em>neutral</em> (?).</t>

<t anchor="_5cddd076-1acc-64c4-fd4b-d4af2e642b95">Note: A failure in SPF doesn't mean delivery won't happen, however depending on the policies of the receiving
system, messages classified with <em>hard failure</em> or <em>soft failure</em> may not be delivered or marked as spam.</t>

<t anchor="_ad284317-a232-f5ff-91eb-1eb17b4e2be4">The use of "all" at the end  is pretty common, although some providers mark it as ~ (soft fail) or ? (neutral).
The reality is that a good SPF record is tuned based on what services are attached to a domain. Not just one
individual service.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="multiple-services"><name>Multiple Services</name>

<t anchor="_c0d9b115-5177-a9e8-eb32-74eee8212f52">If only one email sending service were active, the SPF record recommended by the provider is sufficient. But
mail from a domain can often come from several different services.</t>

<t anchor="_bf087d47-8dc3-ea33-87b3-44069ef0eb5c">A very typical use case might be end user mail and an email newsletter service.
Let's look at the SPF records recommended for individual services.</t>

<t anchor="_f18d7c52-d185-04aa-a032-80846b594ca4">Mailer1: v=spf1 include:spf.mailer1.example -all
Newsletter1: v=spf1 include:_spf.newsletter.example ~all</t>

<t anchor="_a477c312-1138-6231-64cc-fcd8c55c4922">All of these examples use the include syntax. This is fairly common. The use of all at the end is common,
although is often inconsistent with the modifier.</t>

<t anchor="_693b9f43-171e-4e8b-1326-c0bddbe40ba6">If a user installed Mailer1 and Newsletter1, their combined SPF record ought to be something like:</t>

<sourcecode anchor="_c810b221-7012-3dd9-4f1b-0677dcfc784e"><![CDATA[v=spf1 include:spf.mailer1.example include:_spf.newsletter.example
 ~all]]></sourcecode>


<t anchor="_a74a75b8-5435-2c13-0f4c-636c16d0ce51">We combined the two rules, and in this case picked the least restrictive all modifier.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="_spf_record_merging"><name>SPF Record Merging</name>

<t anchor="_c18f3cc2-71ed-ade5-8826-8b00a74dbbe0">The challenge with SPF records and Domain Connect is that an individual service might recommend an SPF record. If only one service were active, this would be accurate. But with several services together only the DNS Provider is able to determine the valid shape of a SPF TXT record.</t>

<t anchor="_869a5f6b-fa02-2bce-4144-b18b7cbf65d1">One solution to this problem is to merge all related records. At the highest level, this means taking everything between the "v=spf1" and the "all" from each of the records and merging them together, terminating with hard-coded modifier on <em>all</em> at the end.  For an SPF record to fulfill it's purpose of protection against malicious email delivery, Domain Connect advises a fixed modifier <em>"~"</em> advising lower rating of the messages from other sources not specified in SPF. This setup offers a reasonable level of protection of mail delivery, on the other side does not reject the message in case forwarding facility is in place.</t>

<sourcecode anchor="_75b10e19-322a-b28b-e809-614736e5a9f0"><![CDATA[@ TXT v=spf1 include:spf.mailer1.example include:_spf.newsletter.exam
ple ~all]]></sourcecode>


<t anchor="_a9297820-9ee9-af64-f1b1-7efe866d5950">The other would be to write intermediate records, and reference these locally.</t>

<sourcecode anchor="_16530b16-c71e-ddc1-f1f8-3ef5bc0bb451"><![CDATA[r1.example.com. TXT v=spf1 include:spf.mailer1.example ~all
r2.example.com. TXT v=spf1 include:_spf.newsletter.example ~all
@ TXT v=spf1 include:r1.example.com include:r2.example.com ~all]]></sourcecode>


<t anchor="_5b84b1c6-cfcc-cfc7-4fe6-94111f4e403c">There are advantages and disadvantages to both approaches.  SPF records have a limit of 10 DNS lookups and record length is limited to 255 characters.  So depending on the embedded records both approaches might have advantages.</t>

<t anchor="_ea5f9937-f8f4-ee09-8ed5-853dc99620b4">The implementation would be left to the DNS Provider, but to facilitate this SPF records must NOT be included in templates.  Instead, we introduce a new pseudo-record type in the template called <em>SPFM</em>. This has the following attribute:</t>

<dl anchor="_28070809-b0d0-ba52-74d8-c05e1d16ef79"><dt>spfRules</dt><dd><t anchor="_0f6eb6b9-9998-2a73-464f-e2cc4d7a580d">Determines the desired rules, basically everything but leading "v=spf1" and trailing <em>all</em> rule -  see: <xref target="template-record">SPF Rules</xref></t>
</dd></dl>

<t anchor="_9b1fdcdb-ef6c-5ea4-fcf2-18191426da2f">When a template is added or removed with an <em>SPFM</em> record in the template, some code would need to take the aggregate value of all <em>SPFM</em> records in all templates applied as well as existing SPF TXT record on the host and recalculate the resulting SPF TXT record. In case several sources specify the same rule with a different policy DNS Provider SHOULD apply the least restrictive one as a result. <em>soft failure</em> SHOULD be preferred over <em>hard failure</em>, <em>neutral</em> SHOULD be preferred over <em>soft failure</em>.</t>

<t anchor="_03a718fc-04a7-17df-b012-a35963d4efa2">DNS Provider SHOULD also allow the end user to modify the SPF record after merging.</t>

<t anchor="_d45ca39d-c396-fe77-ff32-f5b5c42ac607">Due to merging step in between, the resulting SPF TXT records are considered non-essential (see: <xref target="non-essential-record"></xref>). That means the user may decide to override the final calculated value or remove the whole SPF record. This action MUST NOT lead to removal of any related templates in conflict detection and template integrity routines if implemented by the DNS provider.</t>

<t anchor="_f3ab21d9-d384-6c9e-7541-a844bf3141c2">If the existing TXT record makes the merging operation not possible, the DNS provider must handle this situation the same way as a conflict and either let the end-user resolve it in the UX (both in Synchronous and Asynchronous flow) or return the conflict as an error in the Asynchronous flow unless the <em>force=true</em> parameter is used, effectively removing the existing record.</t>

<t anchor="_9bcebf0d-4630-5712-f65f-9a164c13ff86">Service providers should avoid exact match checking content of TXT SPF record, as it might be strongly influenced by the DNS Provider merging strategy and user actions.</t>

<t anchor="_433e4a06-9230-b2b7-7031-d83d9eeb0af5">Some DNS Providers may decide not to support the SPFM record. The following alternative solution should allow general interoperability of the templates for those providers: onboard the templates with SPFM record in variable-compatible form using a regular TXT record with content <em>"v=spf1 %spfRules% ~all"</em>, using property <em>essential=OnApply</em> set to avoid removal of the whole template by a conflict.</t>

<t anchor="_1009f6ab-665e-5373-f227-f86d7fe2ad45">Since implementation of a redirection service is typically simple, it is

<t anchor="_0cc4783c-3641-c951-060d-b2b567307fbe">While technically not a "record" in DNS, when supporting this OPTIONAL

However, some services use an operational convention for defining specific interpretations of an RRset by locating the records in a DNS branch under the parent domain to which the RRset actually applies. The top of this subordinate branch is defined by a naming convention that uses a reserved node name, which begins with the underscore character (e.g., "_name"). The underscored naming construct defines a semantic scope for DNS record types that are associated with the parent domain above the underscored branch. This specification explores the nature of this DNS usage and defines the "Underscored and Globally Scoped DNS Node Names" registry with IANA. The purpose of this registry is to avoid collisions resulting from the use of the same underscored name for different services.</t></abstract> </front> <format target="https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc8552" type="src"></format> <seriesInfo value=" 10.17487/RFC8552" name="DOI"></seriesInfo> <seriesInfo value="222" name="BCP"></seriesInfo> <seriesInfo value="8552" name="RFC"></seriesInfo></reference>
