    <section anchor="_introduction"><name>Introduction</name>

<t anchor="_ee2be90c-9a4b-533a-12ab-112def3bf89c">Connecting a domain name to a service should be a simple and straightforward process.  However, historically, users have faced a complex and often frustrating task involving manual DNS configuration.  Traditional methods are unreliable, require deep technical knowledge of DNS, and result in outdated and confusing instructions from Service Providers.  This leads to user frustration, support overhead, and abandoned setups.</t>

<t anchor="_09308fcb-e6d5-259e-3bd6-512b799d99fd">To address these challenges, Domain Connect offers a streamlined and automated solution.  It empowers Service Providers to easily enable their services to work with user domains, simplifying both DNS provider discovery and DNS configuration.  By abstracting away the complexities of manual DNS management through user-friendly web interactions, standard authentication, and template-based configurations, Domain Connect significantly improves the user experience.</t>

<section anchor="_primary_use_cases"><name>Primary Use Cases</name>

<t anchor="_5da5f986-b3fc-5995-cdd3-6c62bb2ff85e">The following use cases illustrate the wide range of applications where Domain Connect simplifies and automates DNS configuration, from basic service onboarding to complex, dynamic DNS management scenarios.</t>

<ul anchor="_f9c2b312-ceac-485b-9ec4-84e0429c6739"><li><strong>SaaS Provider with One-Off DNS Configuration:</strong> A Software as a Service (SaaS) Provider offering functionality with an option to assign own domain name, such as web hosting or email, can utilize Domain Connect to streamline the process of configuring DNS records for their customers. This automation eliminates the need for manual configuration and simplifies the onboarding experience for users.</li>
<li><strong>SaaS Provider with Multi-Step DNS Configuration:</strong> Some SaaS Providers may require a multi-step DNS configuration process, potentially involving asynchronous operations. For example, a service might require initial verification of domain ownership through a TXT record, followed by the creation of CNAME records for different subdomains. Domain Connect can handle such scenarios by utilizing its asynchronous flow. This allows the Service Provider to obtain user consent and apply the necessary DNS changes in multiple steps, even if the user is not actively present during the entire process.</li>
<li><strong>On-Premise Service with Publicly Accessible DNS Service:</strong> An on-premise service, such as a local network device or server, can also benefit from Domain Connect if it utilizes a publicly accessible DNS service. By leveraging Domain Connect, the service can automatically update DNS records as needed, ensuring that the service remains accessible through its domain name.</li>
<li><strong>Tool or Service with Regularly Updated DNS Entries:</strong> A tool or service that requires regular updates to DNS entries, such as a dynamic DNS service or a DNS-based load balancer, can use Domain Connect to automate the process.</li>
<li><strong>Packaged Software Provider:</strong> A packaged software provider, whether open-source or proprietary, can integrate Domain Connect into their installation and configuration process. This allows the software to automatically configure necessary DNS records during installation, simplifying the setup process for users. However, if the software is installed on a private network with a private DNS service, it might not be directly compatible with Domain Connect, unless the DNS service provides Domain Connect endpoints accessible to the installation process.</li>
</ul>

<section anchor="_use_cases_out_of_scope"><name>Use Cases out of scope</name>

<t anchor="_b989b2ac-e167-7fbf-c972-0c211c4509ce">While Domain Connect offers significant advantages in automating DNS configuration, it's important to recognize scenarios where it might not be the ideal solution:</t>

<ul anchor="_acecd7a0-e852-9868-7abc-27a1f7888c64"><li><strong>Automation or CI/CD Pipelines:</strong> Domain Connect is primarily designed for user-driven DNS configuration, where an end user grants consent and applies changes. Automating this process within CI/CD pipelines or other automated workflows can be challenging, as it requires obtaining and securely storing OAuth tokens beforehand. However, if authorisation tokens are pre-obtained from a user-driven setup process, Domain Connect can be also integrated into automation workflows.</li>
<li><strong>Private/Enterprise DNS with Public SaaS Providers:</strong> Domain Connect relies on public DNS records and endpoints to facilitate discovery and configuration. If a private or enterprise DNS service is used, it might not be directly compatible with Domain Connect, unless the DNS service provides publicly accessible Domain Connect endpoints.</li>

<section anchor="_templates"><name>Templates</name>

<t anchor="_1280b059-1cb4-518f-3065-fdbeec3e6142">Templates are core to Domain Connect, as they fully describe a service owned by a Service Provider and contain all of the information necessary to enable and operate/maintain the service in the form of a set of records.</t>

<t anchor="_fc533c96-2ba4-28f0-367f-ded0ef7bdf8f">The individual records in a template MAY be assigned to a group identified by a groupId. This allows for the application of templates in different stages. For example, an email provider might first set a TXT record to verify the domain, and later set an MX record to configure email delivery. While done separately, both changes are fundamentally part of the same service.</t>

<t anchor="_7a48e459-f1a8-574b-bd49-984fb4f8a633">Templates MAY also contain variable portions, as often values of data in
DNS change based on the implementation and/or user of the
service (e.g. the IP address of a service, a user id,
etc.).</t>

<t anchor="_ee53bb7f-7ef9-ca93-727f-eff8e4cf66e3">The template is defined by the Service Provider and manually onboarded with the DNS Provider, according to a template definition published in the <xref target="repository-and-integrity">Public Repository</xref> or agreed out-of-band between the Service Provider and the DNS Provider.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="_trust_model"><name>Trust Model</name>

<t anchor="_e703e674-9a8b-7365-e9c5-6f1334234182">The Domain Connect protocol relies on a robust trust model to ensure the security and reliability of DNS configuration delegation between Service Providers and DNS Providers.  This model addresses the necessary trust relationships between users, Service Providers, and DNS Providers, centering on secure template utilization and DNS Provider vetting processes.</t>

<section anchor="_trust_establishment"><name>Trust Establishment</name>

<t anchor="_1878a7ec-e438-771b-2266-99224eb23df2">User trust in the DNS Provider is an essential factor. DNS Provider is a trusted party by the fact that DNS Provider has full technical access to the DNS zone already. Users depend on their DNS Providers to accurately reflect DNS record modifications initiated through Domain Connect. Consequently, DNS Providers are expected implement authorization checks to validate user permissions prior to enacting any DNS zone changes. Furthermore, DNS Providers are responsible for translating template specifications into a human-readable format, enabling users to readily comprehend the nature and impact of proposed DNS record changes.</t>

<t anchor="_458b2116-ddc6-02dc-bc1e-0477836f515c">Users would typically place trust in Service Providers to act responsibly and only make DNS modifications that are within the scope defined by the approved template, however it shall be observed that a malicious actor may try to exploit this trust by acting as a benign Service Provider or building a fake one, therefore by default Service Provider shall not be assumed to be a trusted party in the protocol considerations.</t>

<t anchor="_ad89acf1-a696-fb1a-befc-02c559e9f4b1">A foundational element to close this gap is the establishment of trust between DNS Providers and Service Providers. DNS Providers verify the legitimacy and security of templates provided by Service Providers as well as they are able to verify textual information included in the template and provided to the user, such as provider name or service name. This trust is typically established through an onboarding process which may involve contractual agreements or appropriate template acceptance policies.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="_template_security"><name>Template Security</name>

<t anchor="_311176b1-d423-81fc-ae3f-923e52a07b4a">Templates are central to the trust model, defining the permitted scope of DNS zone modifications and restricting Service Provider actions, preventing unauthorized changes beyond the template's specified parameters. The template defines the types of DNS records within the zone and together with a distinct domain name and optionally sub-domain with user consent it defines clearly the part of the zone that the Service Provider is authorized to modify via the template application. Service Providers create templates which are then onboarded by DNS Providers, either adhering to a published template definition or based on bilateral agreements. The DNS Provider has very explicit knowledge and control of the settings being changed to enable a service.</t>

<t anchor="_e2661e51-6f6f-87f2-87fc-be1f3d1aa468">To attach a domain name to a service provided by a Service Provider, the user would first enter their domain name.</t>

<t anchor="_8cdbf3a4-9368-9fc3-5306-0c88627d486b">Instead of relying on examination of the nameservers and mapping these to DNS Providers, DNS Provider discovery is handled through simple records in DNS and an API. The Service Provider queries for a specific record in the zone that returns a REST endpoint to initiate the protocol. When this endpoint is called, a Domain Connect compliant DNS Provider returns information about that domain and how to configure it using Domain Connect.</t>

<t anchor="_c75c8b85-3557-10a3-2c19-19c103e2460c">To apply the changes to DNS, there are two use cases. The first is a synchronous web flow, and the second is an asynchronous flow using OAuth and an API.</t>

<t anchor="_e0ca0ec5-8666-ec4b-045d-4a9ae57cbb89">It is noted that a DNS Provider MAY choose to only implement one of the flows, however it is RECOMMENDED to implement Synchronous Flow which fulfill needs of most Service Providers.</t>

<t anchor="_23d0500c-5c3c-86ce-1252-477ec7fa3adb">Individual Service Providers MAY work with the synchronous flow only, the asynchronous flow only, or with both.</t>

not replace it.</t>

<t anchor="_138b43d2-8d78-df91-b065-0f82ee6355ea">Note: When a Service Provider has a large reseller channel, it is highly
recommended that the Service Provider creates an API for their resellers
to ease the implementation of Domain Connect. There are elements of convenience in doing
this around Domain Discovery and URL Formatting. But this would be required
if the template required signatures.</t>

<t anchor="_eaf1d50e-e9a8-4633-ec29-68f0adad2b2a">Not all DNS Providers will support the asyncronous flow. As such it is recommended that Service Providers relying on an OAuth implementation also implement a synchronous implementation.</t>

<t anchor="_bad1bcc4-3db6-8314-889f-4616f92bc34d">Service Providers wishing to use the OAuth flow MUST register as an
OAuth client with each DNS Provider. This is typically a manual
process, however other solutions like OAuth Dynamic Client Registration <xref target="RFC7591" section="" relative=""></xref> MAY be offered by DNS Provider as well.</t>

<t anchor="_4804b7f9-75cb-2626-9a09-34c3776d04e2">To register, the Service Provider would provide (in addition to their
template) any configuration necessary for the DNS Providers OAuth
implementation. This includes valid URLs and Domains for redirects upon
success or errors of OAuth flow, token validity, presence and validity of refresh tokens etc.</t>

<t anchor="_434bffe3-b3f3-c266-d1c9-8d5672a7a911">Note: The validity of redirects are very important in any OAuth implementation.
Most OAuth vulnerabilities are a combination of an open redirect and/or a
compromised secret.</t>

<t anchor="_eb827cbf-5b24-f43f-8df4-bee992dcc121">The DNS Provider SHOULD give the Service Provider a client id and a secret which will be used when requesting tokens. For simplicity the client id MAY be the same as the providerId, however it is up to the agreement between the parties involved.
Any other form of client authentication within OAuth framework MAY be agreed between the parties.</t>

<t anchor="_7dce12dc-35e0-9182-9e01-7ca603954dcf">To initiate the OAuth flow the Service Provider first links to the DNS
Provider to gain consent.</t>

<t anchor="_76f4b237-b1c3-815b-d078-52aeac50bf4e">This endpoint is similar to the synchronous flow described above. The DNS Provider
MUST authenticate the user, verify the user has control of the DNS Zone for the domain, and ask the user for
permission. Instead of permission to make a change to DNS, the permission
is now to allow the Service Provider to
make the changes on their behalf. Similarly the
DNS Provider MAY warn the user that (the eventual)
application of a template might change existing records and/or disrupt
existing services attached to the domain.</t>

<t anchor="_5ca615eb-e6dd-9a97-99c2-6d56e71f38df">While the variables for the applied template would be provided later,
the values of some variables may be necessary to determine conflicts. As
such, any variables impacting conflicting records SHOULD be provided
in the consent flow. This primarly includes variables in hosts, and
variables in the data portion for certain TXT records.</t>

<t anchor="_4b5ce516-83c0-b89f-ea72-fb88490be671">The protocol allows for the Service Provider to gain consent to apply
multiple templates. These templates are specified in the <tt>scope</tt> parameter. It
also allows for the Service Provider to gain consent to apply these templates to the domain
or to the domain with multiple sub-domains. These are specified in the <tt>domain</tt> and <tt>host</tt>
parameter. If conflict detection is implemented
by the DNS Provider, they SHOULD account for all permutations, in order to inform
the end user of all possible consequences of the authorised change.</t>

<t anchor="_88c8bde4-d249-2005-757c-651650f3dcb9">The scope parameter is a space separated list (as per the OAuth protocol)
of the template serviceIds. The host parameter is an OPTIONAL comma separated

applied to the Zone Apex For example:</t>

<t anchor="_fa45c503-602f-6110-1c39-41488850019c">Once authorization has been granted, the Service Provider MUST use the Authorization Code provided to request an Access Token. The OAuth specification recommends that the Authorization Code be a short lived token, and a reasonable recommended setting is ten minutes, however the specific setup would depend on specifics of DNS Provider's implementation. As such this exchange needs to be completed before that time has expired or the process will need to be repeated.</t>

<t anchor="_23b90a92-f6a6-78f5-c00f-66257db1d5f9">This token exchange is typically done via a server to server API call from the
Service Provider to the DNS Provider using a POST. When called in this manner a
secret is provided
along with the Authorization Code.</t>

<t anchor="_0a420c38-c929-c68a-33b3-558fa385f577">OAuth does allow for retrieving the access token without a secret. This is typically
done when the OAuth client is a client application.
When onboarding with the DNS Provider this would need to be enabled.</t>

<t anchor="_f9e561ad-7af6-46e4-9c3d-7e964d74d010">When the secret is provided (which is the normal case), care must be taken. A malicious
user could create a domain that returns a false _`domainconnect` TXT record, and
subsequently a JSON call to their own server for the API end point. By doing so, they
could then run Domain Connect on their domain and retrieve the secret.</t>

<t anchor="_99373c56-48e6-de50-d79e-4557b0bc2046">As such the urlAPI used for OAuth by the Service Provider SHOULD be maintained per DNS Provider and not the value retrieved during discovery or other measures have to be implemented to prevent token leakage.</t>

<t anchor="_03e3eb18-dfa9-1826-818d-bcff89c92b0c">It is left to the discretion of the DNS Provider to determine what is disclosed to the user
when granting permission and/or applying changes to DNS.
This includes disclosing the records being applied and the records
that may be overwritten.</t>

<t anchor="_e7570b56-0ca1-fc52-91d2-b4937a573cfa">For changes being made, one DNS Provider
may decide to simply tell the user the name of the service being enabled. Another
may decide to display the records being set. And another
may progressively display both.</t>

<t anchor="_4dd16918-db3e-1903-f055-6d8823457641">For conflict detection, one DNS Provider may simply overwrite changed records without warning. Another may detect conflicts and warn the user of the records that will change. And another may implement logic to further detect, warn, and remove any of the existing templates that overlap with the new template once applied (this assumes they are a DNS Provider that maintains template state in DNS).</t>

<t anchor="_927fad37-208b-f437-3971-e5ad01f89136">As an example, consider applying a template that sets two records (recordA and recordB) into a zone. Next consider applying a second template that overlaps with the first template (recordB and recordC). If the DNS maintains template state and removes conflicting templates, applying the second template would remove the first template. Application of the second template would conflict with recordB and the entire first template would be removed.</t>

<t anchor="_d2359d04-5882-0d81-9844-09a42e0fa175">Manual changes made by the user at the DNS Provider may also have
appropriate warnings in place to prevent unwanted changes; with
overrides being possible and removal of conflicting templates.</t>

<t anchor="_eea930df-b43f-7faf-4101-6918aa75e856">For the synchronous flow, this happens while the user is present.</t>

<t anchor="_e520ff00-2f16-d74c-6a36-102af7f13139">For the asynchronous flow, the consent UX is similar. However, the changes are made later
using the API and OAuth. The DNS Provider MAY decide to detect conflicts and
return these from the API without applying the change using the proper response code.
If the force parameter is set, the changes MUST be applied regardless of conflicts.</t>

<t anchor="_b522ca2c-f9e7-79ad-3d06-5939f4363dc5">It is ultimately left to the DNS Provider to determine the amount of
disclosure and/or conflict detection. The only requirement is that after
a template is applied the new records MUST be applied in totality.</t>

<t anchor="_891279ba-6fab-bb45-93f9-53229e46b8b5">A reasonable set of recommendations for the UX might consist of:</t>

<ul anchor="_c903b96a-5ba0-339b-87c5-611161b8d1a5"><li>The consent UX SHOULD inform the user of the service that will be enabled. If the user want to know the specifics, the DNS Provider could provide a "show details" link to the user. This could display to them the specific records that are being set in DNS.</li>
<li>If there are conflicts, either at the template or record level, the consent UX SHOULD warn the user about these conflicts. For templates, this would be services that would be disabled. For records, this would be records that would be deleted or overwritten. This could be progressively disclosed.</li>

<t anchor="_ed8c1eba-75b6-8ad4-deb4-418d2e75573e">Conflict detection done by the DNS Provider prior to template application has to take
into consideration specifics of each DNS record type. The rules outlined below
ensure predictable conflict resolution between DNS Providers. Each rule applies to
the records on the very same host, unless specifed otherwise.</t>

<ul anchor="_2381256d-0027-e4c6-2e02-c1b14cef3683"><li>CNAME record conflicts with TXT, MX, AAAA, A and existing CNAME records, and any other records of these

<t anchor="_dbe27945-98d2-bea2-eaf3-499aca272f8a">Application of this template would be at the domain level for <tt>"example.com"</tt>. This causes problems for application/re-application of the template, conflict detection, and template removal.</t>

<t anchor="_1e30338a-e106-7007-a33b-7f53f20f989e">Since this template would be applied to the domain only, DNS Providers that maintain template state would remove previous instances of the template before re-application.
This means applying this template with <tt>var=sub</tt> would result in the A record for sub.example.com to be set to the value <tt>192.0.2.2</tt>. Later, applying the template on "example.com" with the <tt>var=sub2</tt> should remove the old template before setting the new one. <tt>sub.example.com</tt> would be removed, and <tt>sub2.example.com</tt> would be set to the value <tt>192.0.2.2</tt>.</t>

<t anchor="_e8e1778e-02db-04aa-bae0-f512e09738b0">Furthermore, determining conflicts would be impossible when the user is granting consent for asynchronous operations (OAuth). This is because the host would be indeterminate.</t>

<t anchor="_ac82311d-ef66-efcc-6e75-edff6c1744ac">To solve this problem, templates MUST be considered as scoped to a <tt>domain</tt> and a <tt>host</tt> value. For synchronous operations, the <tt>host</tt> value is specified in the url.
For asynchronous operations, permissions are granted for specific <tt>host</tt> values, whose value is later specified when applying the template.</t>

<t anchor="_e079c4b6-b102-697b-405a-dd8b02f9faba">Some templates might want to utilize CNAME or TXT records with host values containing some form of user identification for validation of domain ownership, and these are often passed in variables.

<t anchor="_fb6d156a-bd93-1842-f2fc-990e6b72036d">SPF stands for Sender Policy Framework specified in
<xref target="RFC7208" section="" relative=""></xref>. It is a
record that specifies a list of authorized host names and/or IP addresses from which mail
can originate from for a given domain name.</t>

<t anchor="_5d620680-60a3-49b2-4412-4ad9248617ab">It manifests itself as a TXT record.  The format of which starts with v=spf1 followed by a list of "rules" of
what to include/exclude.  If a rule passes, the mail is allowed. If it fails, it moves to the next rule.
Typical record might appear as:</t>

<sourcecode anchor="_82d58131-5b2d-10d4-6b2c-8b8fe28ade03"><![CDATA[v=spf1 include:policy.exampleprovider.example -all]]></sourcecode>


<t anchor="_d7cc1203-a46c-52f1-2ef3-e5b5e00d38a5">This is an SPF record with two rules.  The first rule indicates that the rules for SPF record
<tt>_policy.exampleprovider.example</tt> be included in this record. The second rule is a catch all (<tt>all</tt>). The default modifier for a rule is <tt>pass</tt> (+). Other modifiers are <tt>hard failure</tt> (<tt>-</tt>), <tt>soft failure</tt> (<tt>~</tt>) and <tt>neutral</tt> (<tt>?</tt>).</t>

<t anchor="_e3c4c021-7ac6-5cc3-dfd1-516b1970d9d5">Note: A failure in SPF doesn't mean delivery won't happen, however depending on the policies of the receiving system, messages classified with <tt>hard failure</tt> or <tt>soft failure</tt> may not be delivered or marked as spam.</t>

<t anchor="_1f2ccd76-8bf3-63fb-46b6-c7c1d255d682">The use of "all" at the end  is pretty common, although some providers mark it as <tt>~</tt> (soft fail) or <tt>?</tt> (neutral). The reality is that a good SPF record is tuned based on what services are attached to a domain. Not just one individual service.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="multiple-services"><name>Multiple Services</name>

<t anchor="_c0d9b115-5177-a9e8-eb32-74eee8212f52">If only one email sending service were active, the SPF record recommended by the provider is sufficient. But
mail from a domain can often come from several different services.</t>

<t anchor="_bf087d47-8dc3-ea33-87b3-44069ef0eb5c">A very typical use case might be end user mail and an email newsletter service.
Let's look at the SPF records recommended for individual services.</t>

<t anchor="_f18d7c52-d185-04aa-a032-80846b594ca4">Mailer1: v=spf1 include:spf.mailer1.example -all

<t anchor="_a477c312-1138-6231-64cc-fcd8c55c4922">All of these examples use the include syntax. This is fairly common. The use of all at the end is common,
although is often inconsistent with the modifier.</t>

<t anchor="_693b9f43-171e-4e8b-1326-c0bddbe40ba6">If a user installed Mailer1 and Newsletter1, their combined SPF record ought to be something like:</t>

<sourcecode anchor="_c810b221-7012-3dd9-4f1b-0677dcfc784e"><![CDATA[v=spf1 include:spf.mailer1.example include:_spf.newsletter.example

<t anchor="_a74a75b8-5435-2c13-0f4c-636c16d0ce51">We combined the two rules, and in this case picked the least restrictive all modifier.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="_spf_record_merging"><name>SPF Record Merging</name>

<t anchor="_c18f3cc2-71ed-ade5-8826-8b00a74dbbe0">The challenge with SPF records and Domain Connect is that an individual service might recommend an SPF record. If only one service were active, this would be accurate. But with several services together only the DNS Provider is able to determine the valid shape of a SPF TXT record.</t>

<t anchor="_869a5f6b-fa02-2bce-4144-b18b7cbf65d1">One solution to this problem is to merge all related records. At the highest level, this means taking everything between the "v=spf1" and the "all" from each of the records and merging them together, terminating with hard-coded modifier on <tt>all</tt> at the end.  For an SPF record to fulfill it's purpose of protection against malicious email delivery, Domain Connect advises a fixed modifier <tt>"~"</tt> advising lower rating of the messages from other sources not specified in SPF. This setup offers a reasonable level of protection of mail delivery, on the other side does not reject the message in case forwarding facility is in place.</t>

<sourcecode anchor="_75b10e19-322a-b28b-e809-614736e5a9f0"><![CDATA[@ TXT v=spf1 include:spf.mailer1.example include:_spf.newsletter.exam

<t anchor="_a9297820-9ee9-af64-f1b1-7efe866d5950">The other would be to write intermediate records, and reference these locally.</t>

<t anchor="_5b84b1c6-cfcc-cfc7-4fe6-94111f4e403c">There are advantages and disadvantages to both approaches.  SPF records have a limit of 10 DNS lookups and record length is limited to 255 characters.  So depending on the embedded records both approaches might have advantages.</t>

<t anchor="_a4f92cde-2a23-0641-bbd7-645e703cde3a">The implementation would be left to the DNS Provider, but to facilitate this SPF records SHOULD NOT be included in templates.  Instead, a new pseudo-record type is introduced in the template called <tt>SPFM</tt>. This has the following attribute:</t>

</dd></dl>

<t anchor="_9b1fdcdb-ef6c-5ea4-fcf2-18191426da2f">When a template is added or removed with an <tt>SPFM</tt> record in the template, some code would need to take the aggregate value of all <tt>SPFM</tt> records in all templates applied as well as existing SPF TXT record on the host and recalculate the resulting SPF TXT record. In case several sources specify the same rule with a different policy DNS Provider SHOULD apply the least restrictive one as a result. <tt>soft failure</tt> SHOULD be preferred over <tt>hard failure</tt>, <tt>neutral</tt> SHOULD be preferred over <tt>soft failure</tt>.</t>

<t anchor="_03a718fc-04a7-17df-b012-a35963d4efa2">DNS Provider SHOULD also allow the end user to modify the SPF record after merging.</t>

<t anchor="_74d4d3f8-ff89-bd12-176a-076235346654">Due to merging step in between, the resulting SPF TXT records are considered non-essential (see: <xref target="non-essential-record"></xref>). That means the user may decide to override the final calculated value or remove the whole SPF record. This action MUST NOT lead to removal of any related templates in conflict detection and template integrity routines if implemented by the DNS Provider.</t>

<t anchor="_ab664add-3430-6a8c-29a3-bc57f525f6e6">Service Providers MUST NOT check content of TXT SPF record for an exact match, as it might be strongly influenced by the DNS Provider merging strategy and user actions.</t>

<t anchor="_a6e8ebc0-f662-83b7-f459-76755243e186">The Public Template Repository is an open accessible location where Service Providers
MAY publish their Service Templates in the format specified in this specification.
DNS Providers MAY support all of the published templates, just a subset or none of them according
to own onboarding policies (see also: <xref target="onboarding-considerations"></xref>).</t>

<t anchor="_8342b49d-bb4e-5e32-4c45-05c3c581eb55">The template format is intended largely for documentation and communication between the DNS Providers and
Service Providers, and there are no codified endpoints for creation or modification of these objects.
Instead, Domain Connect references a template by ID.</t>

<t anchor="_39aff128-42e2-374c-2494-e94bd9ab2863">As such, DNS Providers may or may not use templates in this format in their internal implementations. By defining a standard template format, it is believed it will make it easier for Service Providers to share their configuration across DNS Providers.</t>

<t anchor="_908ec1f8-a3c1-7b89-ff4a-52405dea54ac">This specification is an open standard that describes the protocol, messages and formats used to enable Domain Connect between a Service Provider and a DNS Provider.</t>

<t anchor="_3157bbd1-6c62-24bd-786e-1be23d17edc0">Any Service Provider is free to define and publish a template. However, the terms and conditions for a DNS Provider onboarding a Service Provider template is beyond the scope of this document. A DNS Provider can be selective in what templates they support, can require a contractual relationship, or even charge a fee for onboarding.</t>

<t anchor="_a4b7a26b-f236-b121-d6e9-afb471e69851">One way a Service Provider can be selective in which DNS Providers they accept is to implement a whitelist of <tt>providerIds</tt>. A Service Provider who chooses to whitelist MUST use <tt>providerId</tt> to distinguish between unique DNS Providers. The DNS Provider's <tt>providerId</tt> would typically be a domain name.</t>

<t anchor="_dd5b0536-6a56-d4a0-a561-397f44e58759">One exception is the domain/host name. This is because a fully qualified domain name is case insensitive.</t>

<t anchor="_51d20d9f-56ea-483f-ae60-5b952987b0c6">Additional record types and/or extensions to records in the template can be implemented on a per DNS Provider basis. However, care should be taken when defining extensions so as to not conflict with other protocols and standards. Certain record names are reserved for use in DNS for protocols like DNSSEC (DNSKEY, RRSIG) <xref target="RFC9364" section="" relative=""></xref> at the registry level.</t>

<t anchor="_0958c14d-c092-769f-f4b9-a3c952047f38">Defining these OPTIONAL extensions in an open manner as part of this specification is done to provide consistency. The following are the initial OPTIONAL extensions a DNS Provider/Service Provider may support.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="_apexcname"><name>APEXCNAME</name>

<t anchor="_851eba50-c804-d925-f2f6-a373d44a075f">Some Service Providers desire the behavior of a CNAME record, but in the
apex record. This would allow for an A Record at the root of the domain
but dynamically determined at runtime.</t>

<t anchor="_695c2a95-7659-ee6e-5490-5bd1bfd6173a">The recommended record type for DNS Providers that wish to support this
is an APEXCNAME record. Additional fields included with this record
would include pointsTo and TTL.</t>

<t anchor="_16249cf1-9127-744f-3c16-000579c25bda">Defining a standard for such functionality in DNS is beyond the scope of
this specification. But for DNS Providers that support this
functionality, using the same record type name across DNS Providers
allows template reuse.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="_redirection"><name>Redirection</name>

<t anchor="_efa38ed6-1ea4-49a1-33b7-d493b987010c">Some Service Providers desire a redirection service associated with the
A Record. A typical example is a service that requires a redirect of the
domain (e.g. example.com) to the www variant (www.example.com). The www
would often contain a CNAME.</t>

<t anchor="_072ba9fb-1947-fd51-7df4-9c1c2b85f3f1">Since implementation of a redirection service is typically simple, it is recommended that Service Providers implement redirection on their own.
But for DNS Providers that have a redirection service, supporting simple templates with this functionality may be desired.</t>

<t anchor="_e63fab7c-45a9-c89c-0641-274adb440061">While technically not a "record" in DNS, when supporting this OPTIONAL functionality it is recommended that this SHOULD be implemented using two new record types.</t>

<t anchor="_dc51c144-0877-630e-2cd4-2c0dd880b81a">REDIR301 and REDIR302 would implement 301 and 302 redirects respectively. Associated with this record would be a single field called the "target", containing the target url of the redirect.</t>

<t anchor="_5d6467cf-fc16-50b7-b8ce-d4999ac6b6a2">Please note, that setting up an HTTP redirect typically involves setting up a webserver and configuring A and AAAA records pointing to this webserver accordingly. The template may or may not explicitly define those records, as the orchestration and the values would we controlled by the DNS provider, not the Service Provider. The DNS Provider SHOULD however consider those records during the conflict resolution in order to give transparency of the changes to the user.</t>

<section anchor="_nameservers"><name>Nameservers</name>

<t anchor="_40941bb5-6a7c-10e0-033e-c97e9498296a">Several Service Providers have asked for functionality supporting an update to the nameserver records at the registry associated with the domain.</t>

<t anchor="_7a190046-cae7-7908-6f59-346f35fb8d01">When implementing this functionality a template defined at DNS Provider would need to define a set of NS records, typically a minimum of 2 and a maximum depending on the number supported by the registrar system of the DNS Provider, likely with <tt>groupIds</tt> to allow for optionality of those additional nameservers. Each NS entry would then contain a <tt>data</tt> field with desired host names or variables to allow for dynamic setup.</t>

<t anchor="_2c529814-19c0-fe4b-ac44-614b82f4d494">It will be noted that a nameserver update would require that the entity implementing DNS Provider side of the protocol is the Registrar. This is not always the case.</t>

<t anchor="_05ee5372-7fd9-795f-c998-42e44aa0503a">Additional care would have to be taken by the DNS Provider informing the user about the change happening and the impact of the change.</t>

<t anchor="_1ca9934e-e17e-033f-eb28-816f09ffa75d">This functionality is again deemed as OPTIONAL and up to the DNS Provider to determine if they will support this.</t>

<section anchor="_ds_dnssec"><name>DS (DNSSEC)</name>

<t anchor="_6ec9396e-0dcb-ff27-6434-0b31a0dc3885">Requests have been made to allow for updates to the DS record for

<t anchor="_e1c62a99-843f-e696-6fdf-a239754c9829">For DNS Providers that support this record, the record type would be DS. Values will be keyTag, algorithm, digestType, and digest.</t>

<t anchor="_0a289230-1a33-3abd-bdf8-60149657826c">Again it should be noted that a DS update would require that the entity implementing DNS Provider side of the protocol is the registrar, and is again deemed as OPTIONAL and up to the DNS Provider to determine if they will support.</t>

The top of this subordinate branch is defined by a naming convention that uses a reserved node name, which begins with the underscore character (e.g., "_name"). The underscored naming construct defines a semantic scope for DNS record types that are associated with the parent domain above the underscored branch.

This specification defines the generic URI syntax and a process for resolving URI references that might be in relative form, along with guidelines and security considerations for the use of URIs on the Internet. The URI syntax defines a grammar that is a superset of all valid URIs, allowing an implementation to parse the common components of a URI reference without knowing the scheme-specific requirements of every possible identifier. This specification does not define a generative grammar for URIs; that task is performed by the individual specifications of each URI scheme.

Over the years, a modified version of Backus-Naur Form (BNF), called Augmented BNF (ABNF), has been popular among many Internet specifications. The current specification documents ABNF. It balances compactness and simplicity with reasonable representational power. The differences between standard BNF and ABNF involve naming rules, repetition, alternatives, order-independence, and value ranges. This specification also supplies additional rule definitions and encoding for a core lexical analyzer of the type common to several Internet specifications.
