<t anchor="_fee13f8f-5eac-227c-11a9-e079a6fccf70">Configuring a service at a Service Provider to work with a domain has historically been a complex task that is difficult for users.</t>

<t anchor="_4b005150-03aa-ca54-3e8e-76aa984b6592">Typically, a user would try to configure their service by entering their domain name with the Service Provider. The Service Provider then used a number of techniques with mixed reliability to discover the DNS Provider. This might include DNS queries for nameservers, queries to whois, and mapping tables to determine the registrar or the company providing DNS.</t>

<t anchor="_77be41f0-6808-76fb-ab1e-aab7f471ef4d">Once the Service Provider discovered the DNS Provider, they typically gave the user instructions for proper configuration of DNS. This might include help text, screen shots, or even links to the appropriate tools.</t>

<t anchor="_488d2764-49b0-27ab-acfb-918a0ce7d656">Discovery of the DNS Provider in this manner is unreliable, and providing instructions to users would present a number of technologies (DNS record types, TTLs, Hostnames, etc.) and processes they didn't understand. These instructions authored by the Service Provider often quickly become out of date, further confusing the issue for users.</t>

<t anchor="_ca3c4e16-d884-d39d-c8ac-252d5eff53de">The goal of this specificatoin is to create a system where Service Providers can easily enable their applications/services to work with the domain names of their users. This includes both discovery of the DNS Provider and subsequent modification of DNS.</t>

<t anchor="_af620063-936a-bcd8-1632-c39f36709e59">The system will be implemented using simple web based interactions and standard authentication protocols. The creation and modification of DNS settings will be done through the application of templates instead of direct manipulation of individual DNS records.</t>

<section anchor="_templates"><name>Templates</name>

<t anchor="_24885499-070b-90aa-2a17-edc766c6a584">Templates are core to Domain Connect, as they fully describe a service owned by
a Service Provider and contain all of the information necessary to
enable and operate/maintain the service in the form of a set of records.</t>

<t anchor="_e793bbaf-ccff-736c-0dc0-786d3ec79e0a">The individual records in a template MAY be identified by a groupId. This allows for
the application of templates in different stages. For example, an email
provider might first set a TXT record to verify the domain, and later
set an MX record to configure email delivery. While done separately,
both changes are fundamentally part of the same service.</t>

<t anchor="_6f4d33b2-30be-2bf8-6082-deb0a7db6ea1">Templates MAY also contain variable portions, as often values of data in
DNS change based on the implementation and/or user of the
service (e.g. the IP address of a service, a user id,
etc.).</t>

<t anchor="_1bedbd5c-1c60-c3a4-163c-06dcf08aacc6">The template is defined by the Service Provider and manually onboarded with the DNS
Provider, according to a template definition published in
the <xref target="repository-and-integrity">Public Repository</xref> or agreed out-of-band between
the Service Provider and the DNS Provider.</t>

<t anchor="_963a389e-b996-5db6-699a-601198985abb">By basing the protocol on templates instead of DNS Records, several
advantages are achieved. The DNS Provider has very explicit knowledge
and control of the settings being changed to enable a service. And the
system is more secure as templates are controlled and contained.</t>

<t anchor="_a31f5e24-8841-59dd-5fe3-d95a478640f3">To attach a domain name to a service provided by a Service Provider, the user would first enter their domain name.</t>

<t anchor="_67176c5c-038b-ef33-5259-15f9792e8d66">Instead of relying on examination of the nameservers and mapping these to DNS Providers, DNS Provider discovery is handled through simple records in DNS and an API. The Service Provider queries for a specific record in the zone that returns a REST endpoint to initiate the protocol. When this endpoint is called, a Domain Connect compliant DNS Provider returns information about that domain and how to configure it using Domain Connect.</t>

<t anchor="_e3063abe-6fe7-d623-7705-8c78640d8469">To apply the changes to DNS, there are two use cases. The
first is a synchronous web flow, and the second is an asynchronous flow using OAuth and an API.</t>

<t anchor="_ba4f98cc-ea73-8a70-a4a5-aed2ac884b84">It is noted that a DNS Provider MAY choose to only implement one of the flows. As a matter of practice many Service Providers are based on the synchronous flow, with only a handful of them based on the asynchronous OAuth flow. So many DNS Providers MAY opt to only implement the synchronous flow.</t>

<t anchor="_23af634e-cbe1-475f-7fb1-09fcc9679bd2">It is also be noted that individual services MAY work with the synchronous flow only, the asynchronous flow only, or with both.</t>

wishes to make changes to DNS asynchronously with respect to the user
interaction, or wishes to make multiple or additional changes to DNS
over time.</t>

<t anchor="_5751993e-1492-387e-c711-362ded16227c">The asynchronous flow begins similarly
to the synchronous flow. The Service Provider determines the
DNS Provider and links to a consent dialog at the DNS Provider. Once at
the DNS Provider the user signs in, control of the DNS zone for the domain is
verified, and consent is granted.</t>

<t anchor="_c5ea83f1-dd1c-9a53-62d6-c81c5a247021">Instead of applying the DNS changes on user consent, OAuth access is
granted to the Service Provider. An OAuth access code is generated and
handed back to the Service Provider. The Service Provider then requests
an access (bearer) token.</t>

<t anchor="_83ea585a-7bec-6d67-c92e-d31ef9a2d97a">The permission granted in the OAuth token is a right for the Service

<section anchor="_shared_templates"><name>Shared Templates</name>

<t anchor="_3349bcb1-0391-d73b-5881-133868886849">Some templates can be called by multiple companies, or be used for different purposes.</t>

<t anchor="_f32000d6-a5da-43f3-a0bb-47a9a7d079ab">For example, most services are sold and provided by the same company. However, some
Service Providers have a reseller channel. This allows the service to be
provided by the Service Provider, but sold through third parties.
It is often this third party reseller that configures DNS.</t>

<t anchor="_f82210cc-ddc5-d07c-01d4-be6ecdf61cd4">While each reseller could enable Domain Connect, this is inefficient for
the DNS Providers. Enabling a single template that is shared by multiple
resellers would be more optimal.</t>

<t anchor="_f01822d8-7fee-1764-93c7-3ce3b6743ab0">As another example, some templates may be used for different purposes by the same company.</t>

<t anchor="_1924be4e-1558-d5d6-8c9c-751e36570bb3">To facilitate these use cases, the ability to pass in additional context for the display
of the providerName and serviceName is enabled. This is only allowed when the template enables the capability
through the sharedProviderName and/or sharedServiceName flags.</t>

<t anchor="_ff09a0f3-6d9d-7269-30bb-8ba594a6fbaa">Note: The shared flag used to be used for this purpose, but has been deprecated.</t>

<t anchor="_a2a7c6aa-11e6-38da-ac13-9f6048c720df">The exact message presented to the user is up to the DNS Provider. However it is recommended
that these fields be used to augment the display of the serviceName and providerName from the template,
not replace it.</t>

<t anchor="_b3b0004d-67dc-774c-0549-60c8c6881cea">Note: When a Service Provider has a large reseller channel, it is highly
recommended that the Service Provider creates an API for their resellers
to ease the implementation of Domain Connect. There are elements of convenience in doing
this around Domain Discovery and URL Formatting. But this would be required
if the template required signatures.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="_verification_of_changes"><name>Verification of Changes</name>

<t anchor="_aa0fd61f-5312-881f-ed33-0e1881963d93">There are circumstances where the Service Provider may wish to verify
that the template was successfully applied. Without Domain Donnect, this
typically involved the Service Provider querying DNS to see if the
changes to DNS had been made.</t>

<t anchor="_0205ee00-4da1-2a9a-1551-27de33371bbc">This same technique works with Domain Connect, and if necessary can be
triggered either manually on the Service Provider site or automatically
upon page/window activation in the browser when the browser window for
the DNS Provider is closed.</t>

<t anchor="_98a0a766-1076-c6ef-42d6-b299b36a3c64">When the redirect_uri is used and an error is not present in the URI,
the Service Provider can not assume the changes were applied to DNS. While true in most
circumstances, users can tamper with or alter the return
url in the browser. As such it is recommend that enablement of a service
be based on verification of changes to DNS.</t>

<t anchor="_86b41086-efad-7395-6479-bd6c1dc5d3e4">Not all DNS Providers will support the asyncronous flow. As such it is recommended that Service Providers relying on an OAuth implementation also implement a synchronous implementation.</t>

<t anchor="_3578a3c6-28ac-d498-05ab-53b4e40083c5">Service Providers wishing to use the OAuth flow MUST register as an
OAuth client with each DNS Provider. This is typically a manual
process, however other solutions like OAuth Dynamic Client Registration <xref target="RFC7591" section="" relative=""></xref> MAY be offered by DNS Provider as well.</t>

<t anchor="_a08931db-5b40-bfb4-49d5-81b3c0aa2dd3">To register, the Service Provider would provide (in addition to their
template) any configuration necessary for the DNS Providers OAuth
implementation. This includes valid URLs and Domains for redirects upon
success or errors of OAuth flow, token validity, presence and validity of refresh tokens etc.</t>

<t anchor="_821c13f0-f14c-99b4-830b-a6d0838d2929">Note: The validity of redirects are very important in any OAuth implementation.
Most OAuth vulnerabilities are a combination of an open redirect and/or a
compromised secret.</t>

<t anchor="_b2c190b4-dd9c-5f0f-2e52-531e3c971b14">The DNS Provider SHOULD give the Service Provider a client id and a secret which will be used when requesting tokens. For simplicity the client id MAY be the same as the providerId, however it is up to the agreement between the parties involved.
Any other form of client authentication within OAuth framework MAY be agreed between the parties.</t>

<t anchor="_593b6e18-f111-16e2-e497-b06ca8d4dc61">To initiate the OAuth flow the Service Provider first links to the DNS
Provider to gain consent.</t>

<t anchor="_170fc764-6374-7fd0-e6ab-f7ab8d77f5fd">This endpoint is similar to the synchronous flow described above. The DNS Provider
MUST authenticate the user, verify the user has control of the DNS Zone for the domain, and ask the user for
permission. Instead of permission to make a change to DNS, the permission
is now to allow the Service Provider to
make the changes on their behalf. Similarly the
DNS Provider MAY warn the user that (the eventual)
application of a template might change existing records and/or disrupt
existing services attached to the domain.</t>

<t anchor="_37639baf-b18f-b29a-8d83-f26ade927c87">While the variables for the applied template would be provided later,
the values of some variables may be necessary to determine conflicts. As
such, any variables impacting conflicting records SHOULD be provided
in the consent flow. This primarly includes variables in hosts, and
variables in the data portion for certain TXT records.</t>

<t anchor="_23d85be6-d702-a600-4c2b-f6bad40c732e">The protocol allows for the Service Provider to gain consent to apply
multiple templates. These templates are specified in the <tt>scope</tt> parameter. It
also allows for the Service Provider to gain consent to apply these templates to the domain
or to the domain with multiple sub-domains. These are specified in the <tt>domain</tt> and <tt>host</tt>
parameter. If conflict detection is implemented
by the DNS Provider, they SHOULD account for all permutations, in order to inform
the end user of all possible consequences of the authorised change.</t>

<t anchor="_4dbd3a26-f553-5fc9-0a5a-a00d870cac3c">The scope parameter is a space separated list (as per the OAuth protocol)
of the template serviceIds. The host parameter is an OPTIONAL comma separated
list of hosts. A blank entry for the host implies the template can be
applied to the Zone Apex For example:</t>

<t anchor="_1c952324-2740-97f7-c2aa-bb842811cf74">Once authorization has been granted, the Service Provider MUST use the Authorization Code provided to request an Access Token. The OAuth specification recommends that the Authorization Code be a short lived token, and a reasonable recommended setting is ten minutes, however the specific setup would depend on specifics of DNS Provider's implementation. As such this exchange needs to be completed before that time has expired or the process will need to be repeated.</t>

<t anchor="_c2426a1b-f6ab-bd8c-5ca6-de4a6fde5afe">This token exchange is typically done via a server to server API call from the
Service Provider to the DNS Provider using a POST. When called in this manner a
secret is provided
along with the Authorization Code.</t>

<t anchor="_e1561674-fd29-d6e1-ffaa-50eec639abeb">OAuth does allow for retrieving the access token without a secret. This is typically
done when the OAuth client is a client application.
When onboarding with the DNS Provider this would need to be enabled.</t>

<t anchor="_297b872d-06bc-00dd-b796-a4d9f149817d">When the secret is provided (which is the normal case), care must be taken. A malicious
user could create a domain that returns a false _`domainconnect` TXT record, and
subsequently a JSON call to their own server for the API end point. By doing so, they
could then run Domain Connect on their domain and retrieve the secret.</t>

<t anchor="_5a334195-e1c7-0b20-235d-5fe835af55a7">As such the urlAPI used for OAuth by the Service Provider SHOULD be maintained per DNS Provider and not the value retrieved during discovery or other measures have to be implemented to prevent token leakage.</t>

<t anchor="_45be15dd-2fb3-111a-2947-aba814fb9324">For conflict detection, one DNS Provider may simply overwrite changed records without warning. Another may detect conflicts and warn the user of the records that will change. And another may implement logic to further detect, warn, and remove any of the existing templates that overlap with the new template once applied (this assumes they are a DNS Provider that maintains template state in DNS).</t>

<t anchor="_8faac642-0b45-a820-5800-2ffbdd25a751">As an example, consider applying a template that sets two records (recordA and recordB) into a zone. Next consider applying a second template that overlaps with the first template (recordB and recordC). If the DNS maintains template state and removes conflicting templates, applying the second template would remove the first template. Application of the second template would conflict with recordB and the entire first template would be removed.</t>

<t anchor="_7948e0bf-6950-064d-69f0-46435eaed072">Manual changes made by the user at the DNS Provider may also have
appropriate warnings in place to prevent unwanted changes; with
overrides being possible and removal of conflicting templates.</t>

<t anchor="_ed681040-c672-5c36-d83e-d2c2adb8fbba">For the synchronous flow, this happens while the user is present.</t>

<t anchor="_3c44f1c1-40d8-ebc9-dc96-025706c276e7">For the asynchronous flow, the consent UX is similar. However, the changes are made later
using the API and OAuth. The DNS Provider MAY decide to detect conflicts and
return these from the API without applying the change using the proper response code.
If the force parameter is set, the changes MUST be applied regardless of conflicts.</t>

<t anchor="_585deeca-bd1d-228c-016f-1bbc998edfcb">It is ultimately left to the DNS Provider to determine the amount of
disclosure and/or conflict detection. The only requirement is that after
a template is applied the new records MUST be applied in totality.</t>

<t anchor="_b9237900-55e8-c463-ebe3-375681847c5e">A reasonable set of recommendations for the UX might consist of:</t>

<ul anchor="_bb83977d-b9b2-f81e-7d16-63098b406af2"><li>The consent UX SHOULD inform the user of the service that will be enabled. If the user want to know the specifics, the DNS Provider could provide a "show details" link to the user. This could display to them the specific records that are being set in DNS.</li>
<li>If there are conflicts, either at the template or record level, the consent UX SHOULD warn the user about these conflicts. For templates, this would be services that would be disabled. For records, this would be records that would be deleted or overwritten. This could be progressively disclosed.</li>

<t anchor="_bf7fa2fc-d131-5146-d592-ac225839e492">This may not be desireable for all templates, as a limited set of templates are designed to be applied multiple times. To faciliate this the template can have the flag <xref target="template-definition">multiInstance</xref>

<t anchor="_c1e17881-73ae-c0b1-493d-1478143f9f8b">While templates do allow for variables in a host or name field values, these SHOULD be used very sparingly.</t>

<t anchor="_d08c5568-779e-a244-1c25-63908ee2e62d">As an example, consider setting up hosting for a site. But instead of applying the template to a domain/host, the name of the host is placed as a variable in the template.</t>

<t anchor="_a4123deb-cc6f-cb72-1da7-f5696cc758e2">Such a template might contain an A record of the form:</t>

<t anchor="_3db97b2e-c77b-7760-04a7-81368b3f8804">Application of this template would be at the domain level for <tt>"example.com"</tt>. This causes problems for application/re-application of the template, conflict detection, and template removal.</t>

<t anchor="_db6f126c-3bdb-42ce-1d30-4bd3736fc52e">Since this template would be applied to the domain only, DNS Providers that maintain template state would remove previous instances of the template before re-application.
This means applying this template with <tt>var=sub</tt> would result in the A record for sub.example.com to be set to the value <tt>192.0.2.2</tt>. Later, applying the template on "example.com" with the <tt>var=sub2</tt> should remove the old template before setting the new one. <tt>sub.example.com</tt> would be removed, and <tt>sub2.example.com</tt> would be set to the value <tt>192.0.2.2</tt>.</t>

<t anchor="_29e51bbb-8fcc-ef74-4ad6-11a87e2c4349">Furthermore, determining conflicts would be impossible when the user is granting consent for asynchronous operations (OAuth). This is because the host would be indeterminate.</t>

<t anchor="_16a86c04-4498-e295-3c0f-a1d4e61e872a">To solve this problem, templates MUST be considered as scoped to a <tt>domain</tt> and a <tt>host</tt> value. For synchronous operations, the <tt>host</tt> value is specified in the url.
For asynchronous operations, permissions are granted for specific <tt>host</tt> values, whose value is later specified when applying the template.</t>

<t anchor="_da81ca71-b0cc-e5f0-8d76-c32142a9402f">Some templates might want to utilize CNAME or TXT records with host values containing some form of user identification for validation of domain ownership, and these are often passed in variables. In those cases usage of variables in <tt>host</tt> field value can be applied without risk of issues mentioned above.

<section anchor="_what_is_spf"><name>What is SPF?</name>

<t anchor="_1cacd893-f110-363a-0f85-ce105178e048">SPF stands for Sender Policy Framework specified in
<xref target="RFC7208" section="" relative=""></xref>. It is a
record that specifies a list of authorized host names and/or IP addresses from which mail
can originate from for a given domain name.</t>

<t anchor="_7a24992f-ef53-cc61-9bb8-abeb8e1af5f3">It manifests itself as a TXT record.  The format of which starts with v=spf1 followed by a list of "rules" of
what to include/exclude.  If a rule passes, the mail is allowed. If it fails, it moves to the next rule.
Typical record might appear as:</t>

<sourcecode anchor="_5f39bbe8-2204-9f33-cc64-58dc1b089ecb"><![CDATA[v=spf1 include:policy.exampleprovider.example -all]]></sourcecode>


<t anchor="_91ee0fcc-a795-c2df-c724-c0027c8e7535">This is an SPF record with two rules.  The first rule indicates that the rules for SPF record
<tt>_policy.exampleprovider.example</tt> be included in this record. The second rule is a catch all (<tt>all</tt>). The default modifier for a rule is <tt>pass</tt> (+). Other modifiers are <tt>hard failure</tt> (<tt>-</tt>), <tt>soft failure</tt> (<tt>~</tt>) and <tt>neutral</tt> (<tt>?</tt>).</t>

<t anchor="_a2a320bf-876a-0d1a-3248-f0dd24885155">Note: A failure in SPF doesn't mean delivery won't happen, however depending on the policies of the receiving system, messages classified with <tt>hard failure</tt> or <tt>soft failure</tt> may not be delivered or marked as spam.</t>

<t anchor="_c2040a34-86a8-3b09-35d7-fdf398a266f7">The use of "all" at the end  is pretty common, although some providers mark it as <tt>~</tt> (soft fail) or <tt>?</tt> (neutral). The reality is that a good SPF record is tuned based on what services are attached to a domain. Not just one individual service.</t>

<section anchor="multiple-services"><name>Multiple Services</name>

<t anchor="_0a0e9221-4692-74ee-3252-e8b7512c480d">If only one email sending service were active, the SPF record recommended by the provider is sufficient. But
mail from a domain can often come from several different services.</t>

<t anchor="_87fbf50f-e588-d3a0-a9f2-e2ed095b62c5">A very typical use case might be end user mail and an email newsletter service.
Let's look at the SPF records recommended for individual services.</t>

<t anchor="_b86ef6be-e92a-8637-3204-ae7ae79ea4f8">Mailer1: v=spf1 include:spf.mailer1.example -all

<t anchor="_97a1a3f3-5a70-a30d-06b2-b7df7f0e75fd">All of these examples use the include syntax. This is fairly common. The use of all at the end is common,
although is often inconsistent with the modifier.</t>

<t anchor="_544bff6f-7d8c-78ad-cdbe-f4382adafc85">If a user installed Mailer1 and Newsletter1, their combined SPF record ought to be something like:</t>

<t anchor="_e5a00c59-fdfd-9adb-fa4e-e8b535e148e0">The challenge with SPF records and Domain Connect is that an individual service might recommend an SPF record. If only one service were active, this would be accurate. But with several services together only the DNS Provider is able to determine the valid shape of a SPF TXT record.</t>

<t anchor="_6549db41-1747-2db1-a7cd-9a34ecba2c07">One solution to this problem is to merge all related records. At the highest level, this means taking everything between the "v=spf1" and the "all" from each of the records and merging them together, terminating with hard-coded modifier on <tt>all</tt> at the end.  For an SPF record to fulfill it's purpose of protection against malicious email delivery, Domain Connect advises a fixed modifier <tt>"~"</tt> advising lower rating of the messages from other sources not specified in SPF. This setup offers a reasonable level of protection of mail delivery, on the other side does not reject the message in case forwarding facility is in place.</t>

<t anchor="_e1a05ef9-cb9e-2634-8fba-87e4ef3b8af1">The other would be to write intermediate records, and reference these locally.</t>

<t anchor="_9960ba23-b1d3-f5a5-021b-136f2fdca440">There are advantages and disadvantages to both approaches.  SPF records have a limit of 10 DNS lookups and record length is limited to 255 characters.  So depending on the embedded records both approaches might have advantages.</t>

<t anchor="_134c2ed1-98a9-aa03-ff81-852fefa3fda9">The implementation would be left to the DNS Provider, but to facilitate this SPF records SHOULD NOT be included in templates.  Instead, a new pseudo-record type is introduced in the template called <tt>SPFM</tt>. This has the following attribute:</t>

<t anchor="_33d099eb-5bed-c885-fdf0-5e28b14645e7">When a template is added or removed with an <tt>SPFM</tt> record in the template, some code would need to take the aggregate value of all <tt>SPFM</tt> records in all templates applied as well as existing SPF TXT record on the host and recalculate the resulting SPF TXT record. In case several sources specify the same rule with a different policy DNS Provider SHOULD apply the least restrictive one as a result. <tt>soft failure</tt> SHOULD be preferred over <tt>hard failure</tt>, <tt>neutral</tt> SHOULD be preferred over <tt>soft failure</tt>.</t>

<t anchor="_c55eb9cc-49c6-9a24-96df-4dc16f892a00">DNS Provider SHOULD also allow the end user to modify the SPF record after merging.</t>

<t anchor="_45f3c2c7-c377-ac42-e910-721de5c979d9">Due to merging step in between, the resulting SPF TXT records are considered non-essential (see: <xref target="non-essential-record"></xref>). That means the user may decide to override the final calculated value or remove the whole SPF record. This action MUST NOT lead to removal of any related templates in conflict detection and template integrity routines if implemented by the DNS Provider.</t>

<t anchor="_f0b9a87b-ea9e-04b3-e385-230046c24e6d">If the existing TXT record makes the merging operation not possible, the DNS Provider MUST handle this situation the same way as a conflict and either let the end-user resolve it in the UX (both in Synchronous and Asynchronous flow) or return the conflict as an error in the Asynchronous flow unless the <tt>force=true</tt> parameter is used, effectively removing the existing record.</t>

<t anchor="_a72ea29b-5cdc-9373-cdd3-b7196c7485c3">Service Providers MUST NOT check content of TXT SPF record for an exact match, as it might be strongly influenced by the DNS Provider merging strategy and user actions.</t>

The following alternative solution would allow general interoperability of the templates for those providers: onboard the templates with SPFM record in variable-compatible form using a regular TXT record with content <tt>"v=spf1 %spfRules% ~all"</tt>, using property <tt>essential=OnApply</tt> set to avoid removal of the whole template by a conflict.</t>

<t anchor="_3471d989-85c1-532a-e088-4d513f6ea7d9">The Public Template Repository is an open accessible location where Service Providers
MAY publish their Service Templates in the format specified in this specification.
DNS Providers MAY support all of the published templates, just a subset or none of them according
to own onboarding policies (see also: <xref target="onboarding-considerations"></xref>).</t>

<t anchor="_3a16b2cd-3976-fdd5-454b-1f4d7eafd030">The template format is intended largely for documentation and communication between the DNS Providers and
Service Providers, and there are no codified endpoints for creation or modification of these objects.
Instead, Domain Connect references a template by ID.</t>

<t anchor="_1dd1a07b-9b51-d609-7107-a956a236bb73">As such, DNS Providers may or may not use templates in this format in their internal implementations. By defining a standard template format, it is believed it will make it easier for Service Providers to share their configuration across DNS Providers.</t>

<t anchor="_359bd4b2-bd70-a4f3-0b40-d1b5ce7dd135">This specification is an open standard that describes the protocol, messages and formats used to enable Domain Connect between a Service Provider and a DNS Provider.</t>

<t anchor="_7f17ba1a-5101-829e-7176-b6e6f514727f">Any Service Provider is free to define and publish a template. However, the terms and conditions for a DNS Provider onboarding a Service Provider template is beyond the scope of this document. A DNS Provider can be selective in what templates they support, can require a contractual relationship, or even charge a fee for onboarding.</t>

<t anchor="_ce76ab60-bb23-96e3-baea-4ca965cc3d9f">One way a Service Provider can be selective in which DNS Providers they accept is to implement a whitelist of <tt>providerIds</tt>. A Service Provider who chooses to whitelist MUST use <tt>providerId</tt> to distinguish between unique DNS Providers. The DNS Provider's <tt>providerId</tt> would typically be a domain name.</t>

<t anchor="_06f42af4-8668-e4e6-bca3-3c946bd64d27">Additional record types and/or extensions to records in the template can be implemented on a per DNS Provider basis. However, care should be taken when defining extensions so as to not conflict with other protocols and standards. Certain record names are reserved for use in DNS for protocols like DNSSEC (DNSKEY, RRSIG) <xref target="RFC9364" section="" relative=""></xref> at the registry level.</t>

<t anchor="_27198b77-56e1-7226-42ab-c6b316729218">Defining these OPTIONAL extensions in an open manner as part of this specification is done to provide consistency. The following are the initial OPTIONAL extensions a DNS Provider/Service Provider may support.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="_apexcname"><name>APEXCNAME</name>

<t anchor="_4f2fadcf-ff82-4301-405a-fe4df20bace6">Some Service Providers desire the behavior of a CNAME record, but in the
apex record. This would allow for an A Record at the root of the domain
but dynamically determined at runtime.</t>

<t anchor="_2fd75b30-482d-be4f-6374-d5657836de0c">The recommended record type for DNS Providers that wish to support this
is an APEXCNAME record. Additional fields included with this record
would include pointsTo and TTL.</t>

<t anchor="_838f6cf3-301d-8532-840b-79cc6cf4bc11">Defining a standard for such functionality in DNS is beyond the scope of
this specification. But for DNS Providers that support this
functionality, using the same record type name across DNS Providers
allows template reuse.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="_redirection"><name>Redirection</name>

<t anchor="_ec1d85bd-5681-186b-ee3a-aef524763b95">Some Service Providers desire a redirection service associated with the
A Record. A typical example is a service that requires a redirect of the
domain (e.g. example.com) to the www variant (www.example.com). The www
would often contain a CNAME.</t>

<t anchor="_a2e1d5f7-da60-6a0e-3ab4-393809d6b9cf">Since implementation of a redirection service is typically simple, it is recommended that Service Providers implement redirection on their own.
But for DNS Providers that have a redirection service, supporting simple templates with this functionality may be desired.</t>

<t anchor="_91ad3536-edb8-0141-6e96-fd5fbb9b06d9">While technically not a "record" in DNS, when supporting this OPTIONAL functionality it is recommended that this SHOULD be implemented using two new record types.</t>

<t anchor="_c7b334a2-dc4e-a86b-c0e2-2de0495ac677">REDIR301 and REDIR302 would implement 301 and 302 redirects respectively. Associated with this record would be a single field called the "target", containing the target url of the redirect.</t>

<t anchor="_fedf9e8b-fa21-852a-d4a9-bf174078b214">Please note, that setting up an HTTP redirect typically involves setting up a webserver and configuring A and AAAA records pointing to this webserver accordingly. The template may or may not explicitly define those records, as the orchestration and the values would we controlled by the DNS provider, not the Service Provider. The DNS Provider SHOULD however consider those records during the conflict resolution in order to give transparency of the changes to the user.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="_nameservers"><name>Nameservers</name>

<t anchor="_e7b6fa2d-88b3-fb67-87a4-b8a9c62607d1">Several Service Providers have asked for functionality supporting an update to the nameserver records at the registry associated with the domain.</t>

<t anchor="_c88fe559-ec0f-ca5e-d51d-fa8f95fc4efa">When implementing this functionality a template defined at DNS Provider would need to define a set of NS records, typically a minimum of 2 and a maximum depending on the number supported by the registrar system of the DNS Provider, likely with <tt>groupIds</tt> to allow for optionality of those additional nameservers. Each NS entry would then contain a <tt>data</tt> field with desired host names or variables to allow for dynamic setup.</t>

<t anchor="_55197d2f-5b6f-c6e2-8118-486bc716e9c2">It will be noted that a nameserver update would require that the DNS Provider is the registrar. This is not always the case.</t>

<t anchor="_4bcf9d0f-b543-a667-b537-21ece54a9920">Additional care would have to be taken by the DNS Provider informing the user about the change happening and the impact of the change.</t>

<t anchor="_54efb74f-26cc-7aa0-e9f2-d1cf65af837f">This functionality is again deemed as OPTIONAL and up to the DNS Provider to determine if they will support this.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="_ds_dnssec"><name>DS (DNSSEC)</name>

<t anchor="_2968de7a-3771-bc64-ad18-b5caa029eafc">Requests have been made to allow for updates to the DS record for
DNSSEC. This record is required at the registry to enable DNSSEC, but can only be written by the registrar.</t>

<t anchor="_9d88d21d-4462-c629-bbde-7987ca8adc65">For DNS Providers that support this record, the record type would be DS. Values will be keyTag, algorithm, digestType, and digest.</t>

<t anchor="_9cbf854e-24b8-386f-3bb2-790920a18f1c">Again it should be noted that a DS update would require that the DNS Provider is the registrar, and is again deemed as OPTIONAL and up to the DNS Provider to determine if they will support.</t>

The top of this subordinate branch is defined by a naming convention that uses a reserved node name, which begins with the underscore character (e.g., "_name"). The underscored naming construct defines a semantic scope for DNS record types that are associated with the parent domain above the underscored branch.

This specification defines the generic URI syntax and a process for resolving URI references that might be in relative form, along with guidelines and security considerations for the use of URIs on the Internet.
