<t anchor="_3ffbb0fb-0027-4919-9094-f560d5b0c8c6">Connecting a domain name to a service should be a simple and straightforward process.  However, historically, users have faced a complex and often frustrating task involving manual DNS configuration.  Traditional methods are unreliable, require deep technical knowledge of DNS, and result in outdated and confusing instructions from Service Providers.  This leads to user frustration, support overhead, and abandoned setups.</t>

<t anchor="_8cf97ac4-95d4-4f27-adad-e79d76118643">To address these challenges, Domain Connect offers a streamlined and automated solution.  It empowers Service Providers to easily enable their services to work with user domains, simplifying both DNS provider discovery and DNS configuration.  By abstracting away the complexities of manual DNS management through user-friendly web interactions, standard authentication, and template-based configurations, Domain Connect significantly improves the user experience.</t>

<section anchor="_f1e61f16-04d0-8933-354e-3663f2e686fb"><name>Primary Use Cases</name>

<t anchor="_574252b8-12b1-eb99-3472-c66ffcdc4696">The following use cases illustrate the wide range of applications where Domain Connect simplifies and automates DNS configuration, from basic service onboarding to complex, dynamic DNS management scenarios.</t>

<ul anchor="_06b1cc58-f7bf-3d0c-0e64-a6de3b09c450"><li><strong>SaaS Provider with One-Off DNS Configuration:</strong> A Software as a Service (SaaS) Provider offering functionality with an option to assign own domain name, such as web hosting or email, can utilize Domain Connect to streamline the process of configuring DNS records for their customers. This automation eliminates the need for manual configuration and simplifies the onboarding experience for users.</li>
<li><strong>SaaS Provider with Multi-Step DNS Configuration:</strong> Some SaaS Providers may require a multi-step DNS configuration process, potentially involving asynchronous operations. For example, a service might require initial verification of domain ownership through a TXT record, followed by the creation of CNAME records for different subdomains. Domain Connect can handle such scenarios by utilizing its asynchronous flow. This allows the Service Provider to obtain user consent and apply the necessary DNS changes in multiple steps, even if the user is not actively present during the entire process.</li>
<li><strong>On-Premise Service with Publicly Accessible DNS Service:</strong> An on-premise service, such as a local network device or server, can also benefit from Domain Connect if it utilizes a publicly accessible DNS service. By leveraging Domain Connect, the service can automatically update DNS records as needed, ensuring that the service remains accessible through its domain name.</li>
<li><strong>Tool or Service with Regularly Updated DNS Entries:</strong> A tool or service that requires regular updates to DNS entries, such as a dynamic DNS service or a DNS-based load balancer, can use Domain Connect to automate the process.</li>
<li><strong>Packaged Software Provider:</strong> A packaged software provider, whether open-source or proprietary, can integrate Domain Connect into their installation and configuration process. This allows the software to automatically configure necessary DNS records during installation, simplifying the setup process for users. However, if the software is installed on a private network with a private DNS service, it might not be directly compatible with Domain Connect, unless the DNS service provides Domain Connect endpoints accessible to the installation process.</li>
</ul>

<t anchor="_9beb328e-19ff-dd26-7949-3bc1511d7bc6">While Domain Connect offers significant advantages in automating DNS configuration, it's important to recognize scenarios where it might not be the ideal solution:</t>

<ul anchor="_307670b5-6db3-5a04-00db-fef7854f0932"><li><strong>Automation or CI/CD Pipelines:</strong> Domain Connect is primarily designed for user-driven DNS configuration, where an end user grants consent and applies changes. Automating this process within CI/CD pipelines or other automated workflows can be challenging, as it requires obtaining and securely storing OAuth tokens beforehand. However, if authorisation tokens are pre-obtained from a user-driven setup process, Domain Connect can be also integrated into automation workflows.</li>
<li><strong>Private/Enterprise DNS with Public SaaS Providers:</strong> Domain Connect relies on public DNS records and endpoints to facilitate discovery and configuration. If a private or enterprise DNS service is used, it might not be directly compatible with Domain Connect, unless the DNS service provides publicly accessible Domain Connect endpoints.</li>

<section anchor="_5cb96e73-a546-b572-74cc-239df13af194"><name>Templates</name>

<t anchor="_01ed9779-ed57-051a-ce6d-a1217fdd612b">Templates are core to Domain Connect, as they fully describe a service owned by a Service Provider and contain all of the information necessary to enable and operate/maintain the service in the form of a set of records.</t>

<t anchor="_9b86bcf8-274d-1fa5-2b02-7127b332f386">The individual records in a template MAY be assigned to a group identified by a groupId. This allows for the application of templates in different stages. For example, an email provider might first set a TXT record to verify the domain, and later set an MX record to configure email delivery. While done separately, both changes are fundamentally part of the same service.</t>

<t anchor="_3c0460cd-a8c1-8085-0d3b-3177b2fee7b7">Templates MAY also contain variable portions, as often values of data in DNS change based on the implementation and/or user of the service (e.g. the IP address of a service, a user id, etc.).</t>

<t anchor="_fc81b17e-6fb5-445b-acc1-aafbcd9a6149">The template is defined by the Service Provider and manually onboarded with the DNS Provider, according to a template definition published in the <xref target="repository-and-integrity">Public Repository</xref> or agreed out-of-band between the Service Provider and the DNS Provider.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="_1b56a3dd-c3b3-cb25-4530-cafb656a8450"><name>Trust Model</name>

<t anchor="_2b545bff-b308-a3eb-fb82-da1eea3a7efc">The Domain Connect protocol relies on a robust trust model to ensure the security and reliability of DNS configuration delegation between Service Providers and DNS Providers.  This model addresses the necessary trust relationships between users, Service Providers, and DNS Providers, centering on secure template utilization and DNS Provider vetting processes.</t>

<section anchor="_c93061f6-7a18-8245-9aa4-e04ecc6a7e16"><name>Trust Establishment</name>

<t anchor="_7a11069d-0afb-1b38-32f7-ae61bef9e425">User trust in the DNS Provider is an essential factor. DNS Provider is a trusted party by the fact that DNS Provider has full technical access to the DNS zone already. Users depend on their DNS Providers to accurately reflect DNS record modifications initiated through Domain Connect. Consequently, DNS Providers are expected implement authorization checks to validate user permissions prior to enacting any DNS zone changes. Furthermore, DNS Providers are responsible for translating template specifications into a human-readable format, enabling users to readily comprehend the nature and impact of proposed DNS record changes.</t>

<t anchor="_3e7d69a0-d5ab-1f12-ce38-2a8f92e08cc9">Users would typically place trust in Service Providers to act responsibly and only make DNS modifications that are within the scope defined by the approved template, however it shall be observed that a malicious actor may try to exploit this trust by acting as a benign Service Provider or building a fake one, therefore by default Service Provider shall not be assumed to be a trusted party in the protocol considerations.</t>

<t anchor="_1deae246-a8ae-5ebb-c370-d5329a5d8f90">A foundational element to close this gap is the establishment of trust between DNS Providers and Service Providers. DNS Providers verify the legitimacy and security of templates provided by Service Providers as well as they are able to verify textual information included in the template and provided to the user, such as provider name or service name. This trust is typically established through an onboarding process which may involve contractual agreements or appropriate template acceptance policies.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="_3c43119a-e32e-4807-e0c4-22310db14626"><name>Template Security</name>

<t anchor="_bf49c8a7-0b9e-b761-de51-1d65b55e77cd">Templates are central to the trust model, defining the permitted scope of DNS zone modifications and restricting Service Provider actions, preventing unauthorized changes beyond the template's specified parameters. The template defines the types of DNS records within the zone and together with a distinct domain name and optionally sub-domain with user consent it defines clearly the part of the zone that the Service Provider is authorized to modify via the template application. Service Providers create templates which are then onboarded by DNS Providers, either adhering to a published template definition or based on bilateral agreements. The DNS Provider has very explicit knowledge and control of the settings being changed to enable a service.</t>

<t anchor="_192579e0-1896-a551-1984-1e0c1e20e7e1">To attach a domain name to a service provided by a Service Provider, the user would first enter their domain name.</t>

<t anchor="_ccda0464-67af-f06c-7621-7467c239f758">Instead of relying on examination of the nameservers and mapping these to DNS Providers, DNS Provider discovery is handled through simple records in DNS and an API. The Service Provider queries for a specific record in the zone that returns a REST endpoint to initiate the protocol. When this endpoint is called, a Domain Connect compliant DNS Provider returns information about that domain and how to configure it using Domain Connect.</t>

<t anchor="_567dbccb-401e-56ce-16ee-d7005d48fbb3">To apply the changes to DNS, there are two use cases. The first is a synchronous web flow, and the second is an asynchronous flow using OAuth and an API.</t>

<t anchor="_33b6321e-36c1-9f5c-a583-c1deb2e0ee73">It is noted that a DNS Provider MAY choose to only implement one of the flows, however it is RECOMMENDED to implement Synchronous Flow which fulfill needs of most Service Providers.</t>

<t anchor="_a307aa69-29c5-ad2a-95da-7fd90c152b2d">Individual Service Providers MAY work with the synchronous flow only, the asynchronous flow only, or with both.</t>

<t anchor="_f6925fca-0214-c862-3603-45d8f3abc8ff">Consider the template above where the IP address of the A record is passed in through a variable. A bad actor could generate a URL with a malicious IP and phish users by sending out emails asking them to "re-configure" their service.

Yet the IP would be hijacking the service.</t>

<t anchor="_9e7b05df-f42e-a89b-9ed1-ccd878adc70c">Some templates can be called by multiple companies, or be used for different purposes.</t>

<t anchor="_71396844-0e26-bacf-539c-4903571e311a">For example, most services are sold and provided by the same company. However, some Service Providers have a reseller channel. This allows the service to be provided by the Service Provider, but sold through third parties. It is often this third party reseller that configures DNS.</t>

<t anchor="_8c4238e2-b965-2e65-4c33-98964e2f5b10">While each reseller could enable Domain Connect, this is inefficient for the DNS Providers. Enabling a single template that is shared by multiple resellers would be more optimal.</t>

<t anchor="_29151cc0-5702-f1d4-4c51-4aa2fabcb5e0">As another example, some templates may be used for different purposes by the same company.</t>

<t anchor="_644b6795-5598-a534-c01a-bec71cdf8ab3">To facilitate these use cases, the ability to pass in additional context for the display of the providerName and serviceName is enabled. This is only allowed when the template enables the capability through the sharedProviderName and/or sharedServiceName flags.</t>

<t anchor="_625a4c5f-1605-e6a3-f97c-dc9bd5a65749">Note: The shared flag used to be used for this purpose, but has been deprecated.</t>

<t anchor="_a5a81f62-4685-e8e5-e33c-e7e5ca93ad62">The exact message presented to the user is up to the DNS Provider. However it is recommended that these fields be used to augment the display of the serviceName and providerName from the template, not replace it.</t>

<t anchor="_086e7b58-0d69-45be-c709-89dcb92df7d2">Note: When a Service Provider has a large reseller channel, it is highly recommended that the Service Provider creates an API for their resellers to ease the implementation of Domain Connect. There are elements of convenience in doing this around Domain Discovery and URL Formatting. But this would be required if the template required signatures.</t>

<t anchor="_df0acadb-760d-6703-386e-58254827e2ba">Using the OAuth flow is a more advanced use case needed by Service Providers that have more complex configurations that may require multiple steps and/or are asynchronous from the user's interaction.</t>

<t anchor="_a47f636b-dd9b-b475-5982-bd95b954f7ad">Details of an OAuth implementation are beyond the scope of this specification. Instead, an overview of how OAuth is used by Domain Connect is given here.</t>

<t anchor="_3024ce6a-263b-a773-7ab5-fd7ab9348229">Not all DNS Providers will support the asyncronous flow. As such it is recommended that Service Providers relying on an OAuth implementation also implement a synchronous implementation.</t>

<t anchor="_0c76c1a0-241b-7210-8f47-5e241df64679">Service Providers wishing to use the OAuth flow MUST register as an OAuth client with each DNS Provider. This is typically a manual process, however other solutions like OAuth Dynamic Client Registration  <xref target="RFC7591" section="" relative=""></xref> MAY be offered by DNS Provider as well.</t>

<t anchor="_6cf14f0a-fe8d-be88-3602-084ca7f326ce">To register, the Service Provider would provide (in addition to their template) any configuration necessary for the DNS Providers OAuth implementation. This includes valid URLs and Domains for redirects upon success or errors of OAuth flow, token validity, presence and validity of refresh tokens etc.</t>

<t anchor="_b861124a-49fd-3b0f-5b57-3cbe729fb77d">Note: The validity of redirects are very important in any OAuth implementation. Most OAuth vulnerabilities are a combination of an open redirect and/or a compromised secret.</t>

<t anchor="_52632d66-45de-79c8-fb84-5d79826afaa8">The DNS Provider SHOULD give the Service Provider a client id and a secret which will be used when requesting tokens. For simplicity the client id MAY be the same as the providerId, however it is up to the agreement between the parties involved. Any other form of client authentication within OAuth framework MAY be agreed between the parties.</t>

<t anchor="_c1be73ca-827c-d7a9-9192-ac0e1dca5bae">To initiate the OAuth flow the Service Provider first links to the DNS Provider to gain consent.</t>

<t anchor="_f54931a8-e2bc-6363-68ee-1179ffeed426">This endpoint is similar to the synchronous flow described above. The DNS Provider MUST authenticate the user, verify the user has control of the DNS Zone for the domain, and ask the user for permission. Instead of permission to make a change to DNS, the permission is now to allow the Service Provider to make the changes on their behalf. Similarly the DNS Provider MAY warn the user that (the eventual) application of a template might change existing records and/or disrupt existing services attached to the domain.</t>

<t anchor="_22e0616a-22d4-f3d7-5ca7-3ec6f7c9dd41">While the variables for the applied template would be provided later, the values of some variables may be necessary to determine conflicts. As such, any variables impacting conflicting records SHOULD be provided in the consent flow. This primarly includes variables in hosts, and variables in the data portion for certain TXT records.</t>

<t anchor="_0d5562b9-e5e2-92d2-b2e2-a67e6ce9ab04">The protocol allows for the Service Provider to gain consent to apply multiple templates. These templates are specified in the  <tt>scope</tt> parameter. It also allows for the Service Provider to gain consent to apply these templates to the domain or to the domain with multiple sub-domains. These are specified in the  <tt>domain</tt> and <tt>host</tt> parameter. If conflict detection is implemented by the DNS Provider, they SHOULD account for all permutations, in order to inform the end user of all possible consequences of the authorised change.</t>

<t anchor="_d579baf6-6b7e-74a2-cce3-e8bd0764850d">Once authorization has been granted, the Service Provider MUST use the Authorization Code provided to request an Access Token. The OAuth specification recommends that the Authorization Code be a short lived token, and a reasonable recommended setting is ten minutes, however the specific setup would depend on specifics of DNS Provider's implementation. As such this exchange needs to be completed before that time has expired or the process will need to be repeated.</t>

<t anchor="_a21a7bd7-7ad0-23c5-ce3a-e477699b8a02">This token exchange is typically done via a server to server API call from the Service Provider to the DNS Provider using a POST. When called in this manner a secret is provided along with the Authorization Code.</t>

<t anchor="_03cf9697-f7f8-439a-b28b-08c58b1374fa">OAuth does allow for retrieving the access token without a secret. This is typically done when the OAuth client is a client application. When onboarding with the DNS Provider this would need to be enabled.</t>

<t anchor="_681bf361-3c8e-f79e-b6c4-0d8196365602">When the secret is provided (which is the normal case), care must be taken. A malicious user could create a domain that returns a false _`domainconnect` TXT record, and subsequently a JSON call to their own server for the API end point. By doing so, they could then run Domain Connect on their domain and retrieve the secret.</t>

<t anchor="_880643fe-d3b9-1bd4-1e2b-fe9d21214cf3">As such the urlAPI used for OAuth by the Service Provider SHOULD be maintained per DNS Provider and not the value retrieved during discovery or other measures have to be implemented to prevent token leakage.</t>

<t anchor="_443bb5c4-db6c-9a50-59af-89771dbafa21">It is left to the discretion of the DNS Provider to determine what is disclosed to the user when granting permission and/or applying changes to DNS. This includes disclosing the records being applied and the records that may be overwritten.</t>

<t anchor="_4f33f9ee-91c1-2550-c5ce-92c32b0efb56">For changes being made, one DNS Provider may decide to simply tell the user the name of the service being enabled. Another may decide to display the records being set. And another may progressively display both.</t>

<t anchor="_4a18df9f-e1ce-8836-fc4e-dc1055f8bdb5">For conflict detection, one DNS Provider may simply overwrite changed records without warning. Another may detect conflicts and warn the user of the records that will change. And another may implement logic to further detect, warn, and remove any of the existing templates that overlap with the new template once applied (this assumes they are a DNS Provider that maintains template state in DNS).</t>

<t anchor="_a9748daf-7a54-1272-1b20-d93c3c1742b2">As an example, consider applying a template that sets two records (recordA and recordB) into a zone. Next consider applying a second template that overlaps with the first template (recordB and recordC). If the DNS maintains template state and removes conflicting templates, applying the second template would remove the first template. Application of the second template would conflict with recordB and the entire first template would be removed.</t>

<t anchor="_5c5c17aa-e0e0-59c2-28ea-5d46b7ee2fa6">Manual changes made by the user at the DNS Provider may also have appropriate warnings in place to prevent unwanted changes; with overrides being possible and removal of conflicting templates.</t>

<t anchor="_33bf36bb-2b97-a5dd-e391-8e4122c5dc1a">For the synchronous flow, this happens while the user is present.</t>

<t anchor="_6dd75643-002d-bd54-36a4-e20cedc41cee">For the asynchronous flow, the consent UX is similar. However, the changes are made later using the API and OAuth. The DNS Provider MAY decide to detect conflicts and return these from the API without applying the change using the proper response code. If the force parameter is set, the changes MUST be applied regardless of conflicts.</t>

<t anchor="_42c6453c-3c1c-8870-df96-47e472c6400e">It is ultimately left to the DNS Provider to determine the amount of disclosure and/or conflict detection. The only requirement is that after a template is applied the new records MUST be applied in totality.</t>

<t anchor="_415cb23e-70b2-378a-25a1-700c314c2c7b">A reasonable set of recommendations for the UX might consist of:</t>

<ul anchor="_fae8304c-40b5-e9ce-6dbc-26160d7271b0"><li>The consent UX SHOULD inform the user of the service that will be enabled. If the user want to know the specifics, the DNS Provider could provide a "show details" link to the user. This could display to them the specific records that are being set in DNS.</li>
<li>If there are conflicts, either at the template or record level, the consent UX SHOULD warn the user about these conflicts. For templates, this would be services that would be disabled. For records, this would be records that would be deleted or overwritten. This could be progressively disclosed.</li>
</ul>

<t anchor="_f21f052a-1f4c-7fca-049d-64fc3a5003bc">Conflict detection done by the DNS Provider prior to template application has to take into consideration specifics of each DNS record type. The rules outlined below ensure predictable conflict resolution between DNS Providers. Each rule applies to the records on the very same host, unless specifed otherwise.</t>

<ul anchor="_242bba56-df5b-b512-741f-0d903bf0109e"><li>CNAME record conflicts with TXT, MX, AAAA, A and existing CNAME records, and any other records of these types conflict with an existing CNAME record. Note: CNAME records cannot be at the root of the zone.</li>
<li>NS records conflict with all other records. This includes of the same host, and for any record ending with the NS host. For example, an NS record of foo will conflict with any foo, <tt>www.foo</tt>, <tt>bar.foo</tt>, etc. Similarly all other record type conflict with NS records in the same manner.</li>
<li>MX, SRV records always conflict with records of the same type</li>
<li>A and AAAA records conflict with any other A and/or AAAA record, to avoid IPv4 and IPv6 pointing to different services.</li>
<li><t anchor="_720711cb-1011-60c0-085c-f4a8fb35514a">TXT records conflict detection is handled looking at txtConflictMatchingMode parameter</t>
<ul anchor="_006d9c8e-8d18-e854-7383-16cda7ca8ea9"><li>None: This indicates that the TXT records do not conflict with any other TXT record. This is the default setting, if not specified.</li>
<li>All: This indicates that the TXT records conflict with any other TXT record</li>
<li>Prefix: This indicates that TXT record conflict with any other TXT containing value starting with txtConflictMatchingPrefix</li>

<t anchor="_d671235e-f486-08dd-2232-8346150d31ca">There is an additional consideration for DNS Providers that maintain the state of an applied template when re-applying a template.</t>

<t anchor="_470a4f96-a649-c6f8-9ae3-f8ec9c14bfba">To avoid unnecessary conflict warnings to the user, under normal use when re-applying a template such a DNS Provider SHOULD remove the previously applied template on the same host.</t>

<t anchor="_544f9cd8-7f36-6651-0f2f-7cef475fb50b">This may not be desireable for all templates, as a limited set of templates are designed to be applied multiple times. To faciliate this the template can have the flag <xref target="template-definition">multiInstance</xref> set. This tells the DNS Provider that the template is expected to be written multiple times and that a re-apply MUST NOT remove previous instances.</t>

<t anchor="_2dfd1a00-e4df-06a9-f45a-e8a918b1c043">This setting only impacts DNS Providers that maintain applied template state. DNS Providers that do not maintain applied template state can only rely on the normal conflict resolution rules, and this flag has no impact.</t>

<section anchor="non-essential-record"><name>Non-essential records</name>

<t anchor="_fb9f8582-4fed-ca0f-3511-714bf87314da">Typically a template specifies a list of DNS records which are required for the service. There may be cases where some records are only required for a very short period of time, and removing or altering the record later (either by the end user or through application of another template) should not trigger conflict detection.</t>

<t anchor="_c02d2dbe-f198-e02b-705d-d3c93eaebc3a">This can be controlled by the <xref target="template-record">essential</xref> property of a record in the template.</t>

<t anchor="_d701be4a-ffa7-26d9-0c37-0af38cda59cb">For DNS Providers that maintain template state, an individual template is scoped to the set of records applied to a fully qualified domain. This includes the Zone Apex and the host (aka Sub Domain) at apply time.</t>

<t anchor="_14fb9739-ebe9-64d6-3ab4-cdd6b0bbde44">As an example, if a template is applied on <tt>domain=example.com&#x26;host=sub1</tt> a later application of the template on <tt>domain=example.com&#x26;host=sub2</tt> must be treated as a distinct template. If a conflict is detected later with the records set into <tt>"sub2.example.com"</tt>, only the records set with this template would be removed.</t>

<t anchor="_087ef81d-34cc-7dc1-75d3-fcab7143bd51">Template records contain the host name of the record to set into the zone (called name for SRV records). This value MUST be considered relative to the domain/host when the template is applied, unless followed by a trailing ".".</t>

<t anchor="_d1638878-46cc-d99c-3654-9b8527824073">Consider a template record of type A with a host value of "xyz". When the template is applied to a domain=example.com and an empty host value, the resulting zone after the template is applied will contain an A record of "xyz" (or "xyz.example.com." as absolute domain name in DNS master file notation).</t>

<t anchor="_e5cb9eb0-639f-325e-5748-5734943f841c">If the same template is applied to a domain=example.com and host=bar, the zone will contain an A record of "xyz.bar" (or "xyz.bar.example.com." as absolute domain name).</t>

<t anchor="_d2a4ec54-9791-02ec-94c0-6ac72f416733">A value of @ for host in the template is a placeholder for an empty value. In other words @ would point to "bar.example.com." when the same template is applied to domain=example.com and host=bar.</t>

<t anchor="_87493741-2d4c-8b7e-7bf5-9bdf3624f02e">A value of <tt>@</tt> in <tt>pointsTo</tt> field in the template is a shortcut for the fully qualified domain name of the domain/host being applied.</t>

<t anchor="_9c5c2fae-cdf3-1cbc-c69c-820585fab34e">There are three Built-In variables:</t>

<ul anchor="_52ada67f-6478-db9a-a107-24fa0f35cac5"><li>%host%: This is the host passed from the query string</li>

<t anchor="_6708cea3-d114-61f7-0b27-735a373fa7e9">The @ variable has special meaning, and can be used in the host/name field or in the pointsTo/data field in isolation.</t>

<t anchor="_c88a08c5-5e7d-848a-e285-edc11dd0a277">For the host/name field it is a shortcut for the value "%fqdn%.".

While the underlying data source (e.g., query string, JSON string) might represent values in different data types, the Domain Connect protocol mandates that these values are interpreted and substituted as strings within the templates.</t>

<t anchor="_66afbeec-01e0-afa9-5a1b-0bb251d978f9">If the data source requires encoding of certain characters (e.g., special characters, spaces), the DNS Provider implementation MUST handle decoding of the value before variable substitution.

<t anchor="_7f72c8f7-4430-2467-c8b3-007175aa9761">Variables are only allowed in template fields of type string, therefore the input field values from the template MUST be decoded from JSON string encoding before variable substitution.</t>

<t anchor="_e8211caf-25f7-0ba1-911a-764001a9d1de">While templates do allow for variables in a host or name field values, these SHOULD be used very sparingly.</t>

<t anchor="_fd901d70-251d-0df4-221b-9ac0bbd169eb">As an example, consider setting up hosting for a site. But instead of applying the template to a domain/host, the name of the host is placed as a variable in the template.</t>

<t anchor="_1dfa5a86-040e-fde5-9ad3-0377a27563a3">Such a template might contain an A record of the form:</t>

<sourcecode anchor="_4be6c24f-f614-198a-495a-353751974b9d" type="json"><![CDATA[{
    "type": "A",

    "ttl": 1800

<t anchor="_9dc2f6cc-9540-63fd-f91a-5ad5862fe32f">This template could be applied on a domain like example.com with the var set to <tt>"sub"</tt>, <tt>"sub1"</tt>, <tt>"sub2"</tt>, etc.</t>

<t anchor="_47a9e631-c905-16bd-e65e-051b4cb49846">Application of this template would be at the domain level for <tt>"example.com"</tt>. This causes problems for application/re-application of the template, conflict detection, and template removal.</t>

<t anchor="_a611d8b2-e793-4a1c-8129-78a1bec26135">Since this template would be applied to the domain only, DNS Providers that maintain template state would remove previous instances of the template before re-application. This means applying this template with  <tt>var=sub</tt> would result in the A record for sub.example.com to be set to the value <tt>192.0.2.2</tt>. Later, applying the template on "example.com" with the <tt>var=sub2</tt> should remove the old template before setting the new one. <tt>sub.example.com</tt> would be removed, and <tt>sub2.example.com</tt> would be set to the value <tt>192.0.2.2</tt>.</t>

<t anchor="_2ecc1d4f-2f5c-46ad-5e78-ea33b3f2a757">Furthermore, determining conflicts would be impossible when the user is granting consent for asynchronous operations (OAuth). This is because the host would be indeterminate.</t>

<t anchor="_f47c0735-6ee7-6059-d1d2-95678cf61ac4">To solve this problem, templates MUST be considered as scoped to a <tt>domain</tt> and a <tt>host</tt> value. For synchronous operations, the <tt>host</tt> value is specified in the url. For asynchronous operations, permissions are granted for specific  <tt>host</tt> values, whose value is later specified when applying the template.</t>

<t anchor="_96bf294e-1c90-798d-f887-5030d1078ec0">Some templates might want to utilize CNAME or TXT records with host values containing some form of user identification for validation of domain ownership, and these are often passed in variables. In those cases usage of variables in <tt>host</tt> field value can be applied without risk of issues mentioned above. In all other cases it is RECOMMENDED not to define variables in the <tt>host</tt> field.</t>

<section anchor="_0dd6b6b3-da60-b5bd-aee2-91a7da9506fa"><name>What is SPF?</name>

<t anchor="_1e8ee3d6-aa89-78ee-c6f2-5cf65bd54837">SPF stands for Sender Policy Framework specified in <xref target="RFC7208" section="" relative=""></xref>. It is a record that specifies a list of authorized host names and/or IP addresses from which mail can originate from for a given domain name.</t>

<t anchor="_fb58cb04-a05c-fd7f-5a05-4e62bf46e018">It manifests itself as a TXT record.  The format of which starts with v=spf1 followed by a list of "rules" of what to include/exclude.  If a rule passes, the mail is allowed. If it fails, it moves to the next rule. Typical record might appear as:</t>

<sourcecode anchor="_aef224a7-4bc3-8695-0903-5d89ea4b1d46"><![CDATA[v=spf1 include:policy.exampleprovider.example -all]]></sourcecode>


<t anchor="_daceb1a0-36cd-fb3a-a534-3ffe1875be48">This is an SPF record with two rules.  The first rule indicates that the rules for SPF record <tt>_policy.exampleprovider.example</tt> be included in this record. The second rule is a catch all (<tt>all</tt>). The default modifier for a rule is <tt>pass</tt> (+). Other modifiers are <tt>hard failure</tt> (<tt>-</tt>), <tt>soft failure</tt> (<tt>~</tt>) and <tt>neutral</tt> (<tt>?</tt>).</t>

<t anchor="_d30a5ee1-619b-28c6-2f7f-5d2d0038deb4">Note: A failure in SPF doesn't mean delivery won't happen, however depending on the policies of the receiving system, messages classified with <tt>hard failure</tt> or <tt>soft failure</tt> may not be delivered or marked as spam.</t>

<t anchor="_577dd4f7-d206-54ab-b51d-4302009b432a">The use of "all" at the end  is pretty common, although some providers mark it as <tt>~</tt> (soft fail) or <tt>?</tt> (neutral). The reality is that a good SPF record is tuned based on what services are attached to a domain. Not just one individual service.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="multiple-services"><name>Multiple Services</name>

<t anchor="_67c24ee1-ccf3-7a8a-b8ec-121e519ac7e5">If only one email sending service were active, the SPF record recommended by the provider is sufficient. But mail from a domain can often come from several different services.</t>

<t anchor="_2625a145-2b1e-fd69-513f-9ffcccf7508a">A very typical use case might be end user mail and an email newsletter service. Let's look at the SPF records recommended for individual services.</t>

<t anchor="_1db6c9c4-82be-9080-cbf1-581f3777d7ad">Mailer1: v=spf1 include:spf.mailer1.example -all Newsletter1: v=spf1 include:_spf.newsletter.example ~all</t>

<t anchor="_62621dfa-02d6-3b7b-1061-19107c40f919">All of these examples use the include syntax. This is fairly common. The use of all at the end is common, although is often inconsistent with the modifier.</t>

<t anchor="_a6be59e0-b427-aa2d-2f98-9dc6353901fc">The challenge with SPF records and Domain Connect is that an individual service might recommend an SPF record. If only one service were active, this would be accurate. But with several services together only the DNS Provider is able to determine the valid shape of a SPF TXT record.</t>

<t anchor="_94356b8b-2511-5e3c-7db3-f3d4fb97a01d">One solution to this problem is to merge all related records. At the highest level, this means taking everything between the "v=spf1" and the "all" from each of the records and merging them together, terminating with hard-coded modifier on <tt>all</tt> at the end.  For an SPF record to fulfill it's purpose of protection against malicious email delivery, Domain Connect advises a fixed modifier <tt>"~"</tt> advising lower rating of the messages from other sources not specified in SPF. This setup offers a reasonable level of protection of mail delivery, on the other side does not reject the message in case forwarding facility is in place.</t>

<t anchor="_625d083e-e4bd-d8a9-4fec-00b50018c816">The other would be to write intermediate records, and reference these locally.</t>

<t anchor="_3722e180-a9cc-d4f0-ca8f-44d4e3a70ba2">There are advantages and disadvantages to both approaches.  SPF records have a limit of 10 DNS lookups and record length is limited to 255 characters.  So depending on the embedded records both approaches might have advantages.</t>

<t anchor="_4516e55f-a18b-9a2e-2be8-5dbd6f0e4779">The implementation would be left to the DNS Provider, but to facilitate this SPF records SHOULD NOT be included in templates.  Instead, a new pseudo-record type is introduced in the template called <tt>SPFM</tt>. This has the following attribute:</t>

<dl anchor="_8c3dd0d3-5d4e-1a48-49ec-8ddba2740424"><dt>spfRules:</dt><dd anchor="_0957f4e3-2f23-3d61-4f6e-2236f848dde2"><t anchor="_0a6c201f-548a-b56b-4dec-546de2365fac">Determines the desired rules, basically everything but leading "v=spf1" and trailing <tt>all</tt> rule -  see: <xref target="template-record">SPF Rules</xref></t>
</dd></dl>

<t anchor="_0c198687-5c32-0e64-5793-3f3c1e815405">When a template is added or removed with an <tt>SPFM</tt> record in the template, some code would need to take the aggregate value of all <tt>SPFM</tt> records in all templates applied as well as existing SPF TXT record on the host and recalculate the resulting SPF TXT record. In case several sources specify the same rule with a different policy DNS Provider SHOULD apply the least restrictive one as a result. <tt>soft failure</tt> SHOULD be preferred over <tt>hard failure</tt>, <tt>neutral</tt> SHOULD be preferred over <tt>soft failure</tt>.</t>

<t anchor="_c5734b42-8db1-9162-e77e-d2ea7d5517d0">DNS Provider SHOULD also allow the end user to modify the SPF record after merging.</t>

<t anchor="_2314391e-0f1d-b38d-dc5d-7c23dc52ff95">Due to merging step in between, the resulting SPF TXT records are considered non-essential (see: <xref target="non-essential-record"></xref>). That means the user may decide to override the final calculated value or remove the whole SPF record. This action MUST NOT lead to removal of any related templates in conflict detection and template integrity routines if implemented by the DNS Provider.</t>

<t anchor="_46588dcb-aa2d-4204-4e21-4e34a6cce4b1">If the existing TXT record makes the merging operation not possible, the DNS Provider MUST handle this situation the same way as a conflict and either let the end-user resolve it in the UX (both in Synchronous and Asynchronous flow) or return the conflict as an error in the Asynchronous flow unless the <tt>force=true</tt> parameter is used, effectively removing the existing record.</t>

<t anchor="_fafc4b51-c4a6-8a7d-5f5b-aabe669b6c17">Service Providers MUST NOT check content of TXT SPF record for an exact match, as it might be strongly influenced by the DNS Provider merging strategy and user actions.</t>

<t anchor="_ef5a71fc-e1ac-3a1f-9890-9908a90ec12c">Some DNS Providers MAY decide not to support the SPFM record. The following alternative solution would allow general interoperability of the templates for those providers: onboard the templates with SPFM record in variable-compatible form using a regular TXT record with content <tt>"v=spf1 %spfRules% ~all"</tt>, using property <tt>essential=OnApply</tt> set to avoid removal of the whole template by a conflict.</t>

<t anchor="_73dda0f0-b178-ba2f-926a-85f15e10077b">Any Service Provider is free to define and publish a template.

<t anchor="_94d973ef-19a0-a890-9e8e-77dd0601d483">One way a Service Provider can be selective in which DNS Providers they accept is to implement a whitelist of <tt>providerIds</tt>.

<t anchor="_14253881-0bda-98a8-fe88-22725581e4e7">Defining these OPTIONAL extensions in an open manner as part of this specification is done to provide consistency. The following are the initial OPTIONAL extensions a DNS Provider/Service Provider may support.</t>

<t anchor="_9cf73af5-ed6c-f739-3ccb-2bae3786d904">Some Service Providers desire the behavior of a CNAME record, but in the apex record. This would allow for an A Record at the root of the domain but dynamically determined at runtime.</t>

<t anchor="_29c6fdfb-a6ef-e10f-c864-5e69db73a087">The recommended record type for DNS Providers that wish to support this is an APEXCNAME record. Additional fields included with this record would include pointsTo and TTL.</t>

<t anchor="_2055aa15-d61a-194b-34cc-81e6d839edf4">Defining a standard for such functionality in DNS is beyond the scope of this specification. But for DNS Providers that support this functionality, using the same record type name across DNS Providers allows template reuse.</t>

<t anchor="_d75c25aa-8944-281e-c6a2-11d57028b0b3">Some Service Providers desire a redirection service associated with the A Record. A typical example is a service that requires a redirect of the domain (e.g. example.com) to the www variant (www.example.com). The www would often contain a CNAME.</t>

<t anchor="_b1a730c3-168f-caeb-bab9-e530701349b8">Since implementation of a redirection service is typically simple, it is recommended that Service Providers implement redirection on their own. But for DNS Providers that have a redirection service, supporting simple templates with this functionality may be desired.</t>

<t anchor="_42c0f9c7-6f7a-8adb-cf7f-764a4caf0a1b">While technically not a "record" in DNS, when supporting this OPTIONAL functionality it is recommended that this SHOULD be implemented using two new record types.</t>

<t anchor="_83f22715-5842-3496-e96c-3def041aaa2b">REDIR301 and REDIR302 would implement 301 and 302 redirects respectively. Associated with this record would be a single field called the "target", containing the target url of the redirect.</t>

<t anchor="_66a76a5c-1fd1-1457-bfbb-294ff96cb402">Please note, that setting up an HTTP redirect typically involves setting up a webserver and configuring A and AAAA records pointing to this webserver accordingly. The template may or may not explicitly define those records, as the orchestration and the values would we controlled by the DNS provider, not the Service Provider. The DNS Provider SHOULD however consider those records during the conflict resolution in order to give transparency of the changes to the user.</t>

<t anchor="_2f56a572-3b42-edcb-f59c-be34d6ff1bd6">Several Service Providers have asked for functionality supporting an update to the nameserver records at the registry associated with the domain.</t>

<t anchor="_35a4555f-c075-fa5e-8ae5-b1f1d2a5cb9d">When implementing this functionality a template defined at DNS Provider would need to define a set of NS records, typically a minimum of 2 and a maximum depending on the number supported by the registrar system of the DNS Provider, likely with <tt>groupIds</tt> to allow for optionality of those additional nameservers. Each NS entry would then contain a <tt>data</tt> field with desired host names or variables to allow for dynamic setup.</t>

<t anchor="_9e2424b0-c58a-5f40-5701-22a49f4ee7cd">It will be noted that a nameserver update would require that the entity implementing DNS Provider side of the protocol is the Registrar. This is not always the case.</t>

<t anchor="_62aa2793-61a4-b55b-61e3-3de3dbce5844">Additional care would have to be taken by the DNS Provider informing the user about the change happening and the impact of the change.</t>

However, some services use an operational convention for defining specific interpretations of an RRset by locating the records in a DNS branch under the parent domain to which the RRset actually applies. The top of this subordinate branch is defined by a naming convention that uses a reserved node name, which begins with the underscore character (e.g., "_name"). The underscored naming construct defines a semantic scope for DNS record types that are associated with the parent domain above the underscored branch. This specification explores the nature of this DNS usage and defines the "Underscored and Globally Scoped DNS Node Names" registry with IANA. The purpose of this registry is to avoid collisions resulting from the use of the same underscored name for different services.</t></abstract> </front> <seriesInfo value="10.17487/RFC8552" name="DOI"></seriesInfo> <seriesInfo value="222" name="BCP"></seriesInfo> <seriesInfo value="8552" name="RFC"></seriesInfo></reference>
